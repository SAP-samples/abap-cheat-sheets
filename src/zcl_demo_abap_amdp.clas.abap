*
*                     ABAP cheat sheet: AMDP
*
* -------------------------- PURPOSE ----------------------------------
* - Example to demonstrate AMDP procedures and functions. It includes
*   a CDS table function.
* - NOTE:
*    - The example covers basics regarding AMDP method declarations
*      and implementations.
*    - The purpose is to give you a rough idea about AMDP. Therefore,
*      the SQLScript code used in the method implementations is
*      fairly simple. AMDP is not needed in simple cases like these.
*    - The example is primarily intended for ABAP Cloud.
*      For example, in ABAP Cloud only read-only operations are possible.
*      In general, there are more syntax options available in classic
*      ABAP. Check the ABAP Keyword Documentation for more details and
*      examples.
*
* ----------------------- GETTING STARTED -----------------------------
* - Open the class with the ABAP development tools for Eclipse (ADT).
* - Choose F9 to run the class.
* - Check the console output.
* - To understand the context and the ABAP syntax used, check the notes
*   included in the class as comments or refer to the respective topic
*   in the ABAP Keyword Documentation.
* - Due to the amount of output in the console, the examples include
*   numbers (e. g. 1) ..., 2) ..., 3) ...) for the individual example
*   sections. Plus, the variable name is displayed in most cases. Hence,
*   to easier and faster find the relevant output in the console, just
*   search in the console for the number/variable name (CTRL+F in the
*   console) or use the debugger.
*
* ----------------------------- NOTE -----------------------------------
* The code presented in this class is intended only to support the ABAP
* cheat sheets. It is not intended for direct use in a production system
* environment. The code examples in the ABAP cheat sheets are primarily
* intended to provide a better explanation and visualization of the
* syntax and semantics of ABAP statements, not to solve concrete
* programming tasks. For production application programs, you should
* always work out your own solution for each individual case. There is
* no guarantee for the correctness or completeness of the code.
* Furthermore, there is no legal responsibility or liability for any
* errors or their consequences that may occur when using the the example
* code.
