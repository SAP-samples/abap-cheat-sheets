* ----------------------------- NOTE -----------------------------------
* The code presented in this class is only meant for supporting the ABAP
* cheat sheets in this repository. It is not intended for direct use in a
* production system environment. The code examples in the ABAP cheat
* sheets are primarily intended to provide a better explanation and
* visualization of the syntax and semantics of ABAP statements and not to
* solve concrete programming tasks. For production application programs,
* a dedicated solution should therefore always be worked out for each
* individual case. There is no guarantee for either the correctness or
* the completeness of the code. In addition, there is no legal
* responsibility or liability for possible errors or their consequences
* which occur through the use of the example code.
