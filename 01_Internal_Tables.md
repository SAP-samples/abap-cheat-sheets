## Introduction

Internal Tables ...

- are tables that temporarily store variable data (i.e. any number of table lines of a fixed structure) in the working memory in ABAP.
- are [dynamic data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendynamic_data_object_glosry.htm), i.e. all properties apart from the memory consumption are determined statically by the [data type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_type_glosry.htm).
- consist of a variable sequence of lines of the same data type. 
- have a [table type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_type_glosry.htm) as its data type (it is a [complex data type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencomplex_data_type_glosry.htm)), which defines the following properties: 
  - [line type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrow_type_glosry.htm)
  - [table category](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_category_glosry.htm)
  - [table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_key_glosry.htm)
- are used when a variable data set of a random data type needs to be processed in a structured way, for example, storing and processing [database table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendatabase_table_glosry.htm) content within an [ABAP program](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_program_glosry.htm).
- allow access to individual table lines via a [table index](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_index_glosry.htm) or a [table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_key_glosry.htm).

### Basic Properties of Internal Tables

<details>
  <summary>üü¢ Click to expand for more details</summary>
  <!-- -->

**Line Type**

- Defines how each line of the internal table is set up, i. e. it describes what columns the table has.
- It can be any ABAP data type, e.g. an [elementary](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenelementary_data_type_glosry.htm) or complex data type as well as a [reference type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenreference_type_glosry.htm).
- In most cases, the line type is [structured](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstructured_type_glosry.htm). In this case, the individual components of a line are also referred to as the columns of the internal table.
- In a simple case, the line consists of a [flat structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenflat_structure_glosry.htm) with elementary data objects; however, it can also be a [deep structure](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeep_structure_glosry.htm) whose components can be structures themselves or even internal tables.

**Table Category**

- Defines how internal tables are managed and stored internally, and how to access individual table entries.
- Why is it relevant? The use of a suitable table category should meet your requirements, i.e. if the internal tables are large, the different categories can have significant performance differences when accessing table content.
- Note: There are two ways to access internal tables:
   - Access by table index: A line of an internal table is accessed by its line number. This kind of access is the fastest way to access table lines.
   - Access by table key: A line of an internal table is accessed by searching for specific values in specific columns. Note: The columns in which you search can be key columns, but they can also be non-key columns.


| Category | Internally managed by | Access | Primary table key | When to use | Hints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`STANDARD`|Primary table index (that's why these tables are called [index tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenindex_table_glosry.htm))|<ul><li>Table index</li><li>Table key</li></ul>|<ul><li>Always non-unique, i.e. duplicate entries are always allowed</li><li>Definition of an empty key is possible if the key is not relevant(`WITH EMPTY KEY`)</li></ul>|<ul><li>If you primarily access the table content for sequential processing or via the table index.</li><li>Response time for accessing the table using the primary key: This kind of table access is optimized only for sorted and hashed tables.

**Key Attributes** 

- There are two types of table keys: a [primary table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenprimary_table_key_glosry.htm) and [secondary table keys](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm).
- Table keys ...
  - are intended to provide an optimized access to the content of internal tables.
  - are either unique or non-unique, i.e. more than one line with the same key (duplicates) can exist in the internal table or not. Regarding the primary table key, the definition depends on the table category. For the secondary table key, the definition depends on the key type. For standard tables, the primary table key can also be defined as empty, i.e. it does not contain any key columns. Note that for standard tables, an optimized access is only possible with secondary table keys.
 - Type of keys:  
   - Sorted keys: 
     - Are either the primary table keys of sorted tables or the secondary table keys of any table.
     - Are managed internally by a table index. In the case of sorted tables, this is the primary table index. In the case of secondary table keys, a secondary table index is added.
     - Access via sorted keys means an optimized binary search.
   - Hashed keys:
     - Are either the primary table key of hashed tables or secondary table keys of any table.
     - Internally managed by a hash algorithm. 
     - There is no table index for a hashed key.

### Table Keys (Primary, Secondary, Standard, Empty) and Table Indexes

<details>
  <summary>üü¢ Click to expand for more details</summary>
  <!-- -->

**Primary table key**

- Each internal table has a primary table key.
- Can be either a self-defined key or the [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstandard_key_glosry.htm).
- The primary table key is ...
  - sorted for sorted tables. 
  - hashed for hashed tables.
- Note that the key fields in sorted and hashed tables are read-only. This is not valid for standard tables.
- The specification of the primary key can be omitted only for standard tables. The primary table key is then automatically defined as a non-unique standard key.
- The primary table key has the predefined name `primary_key`, by which it can also be addressed explicitly. However, its use is optional, and it is usually not necessary to specify it explicitly. You can also specify an alias name for the primary key. 
- When accessing internal tables using the table key, the primary key is always used implicitly in processing statements if no secondary key is specified. Note that the primary table key must be specified in table expressions if the primary key is to be used explicitly.

> [!NOTE]  
> The key can consist of individual key fields or the entire line of the internal table. In this case, the pseudo component `table_line` can be used to denote the primary table key. For non-structured line types, this is the only way to define the key.

**Standard key**
- The [standard key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstandard_key_glosry.htm) is a special primary table key.
- It can be declared either explicitly or implicitly.
- Standard key of an internal table with a ...
   - structured line type: The primary table key consists of all fields with character-like and byte-like data types.
   - non-structured/elementary line type: The entire table line is the key (`table_line`).
- An internal table with no explicit key specification implicitly has the standard table key as the primary table key.
- Why respecting standard keys is important:
  - Sorting of a table can produce unexpected results.
  - Since the standard key can consist of many fields, it affects the performance when accessing the internal table via the keys.
  - The key fields of the primary table key of sorted and hashed tables are always read-only, i.e. using the standard key with these table categories and then (unintentionally) modifying fields can cause unexpected runtime errors.
  - Specifying keys explicitly has the advantage of making the code more readable and preventing the standard key from being set by mistake.

**Empty key**
- The primary table key of a standard table can be empty, i.e. it does not contain any key fields.
- An empty key is not possible for sorted and hashed tables.
- When used: 
  - When the definition of a table key is not important.
  - To explicitly state that a table key is not required, instead of specifying no key definition. Otherwise, the standard key is used, which can lead to unexpected results as mentioned above.
- Declaration:
    -   Explicit declaration using the addition `EMPTY KEY`.
    -   Implicit declaration when using the standard key if a structured
        line type does not contain non-numeric elementary components or
        if an unstructured line type is tabular.
    - Note: When using an [inline declaration](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninline_declaration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") such as `... INTO TABLE @DATA(itab) ...` in `SELECT` statements, the resulting table is a standard table and has an empty key.

> **üí° Primary table index**<br>
> - Index tables, such as sorted and standard tables, have a primary table index. 
> - Each table line receives a unique line number from the primary table index. 
> - The index updates each time a line is added or removed. 

**Secondary table keys**

- Secondary table keys ...
  - are optional for all table categories.
  - can be unique/non-unique sorted keys or unique hash keys.
  - have a self-defined name. An alias name can also be specified.
- A [secondary table index](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_table_index_glosry.htm) is created internally for each sorted secondary key. This allows index access to hashed tables via the secondary table key. In this case, `sy-tabix` is set.
- When accessing internal tables using the secondary table key, the key name (or the alias if specified) must be specified. They are not selected automatically. If no secondary key is specified in a processing statement, the primary key or primary table index is always used. If you want to make use of this key in ABAP statements, for example, `READ`, `LOOP AT` or `MODIFY` statements, you must specify the key explicitly using the appropriate additions, for example, `WITH ... KEY ... COMPONENTS` or `USING KEY`.
- The table access using secondary table keys is always optimized.
- Use cases:
  - To enable different key accesses for an internal table
  - To enable an optimized key access to internal tables (i.e. to improve read performance), even for standard tables
  - To enable index access for hashed tables
  - Standard tables, whose primary table keys cannot be unique, can be provided with a means of ensuring that unique table entries are read. 
  - Typically used ... 
    - for large internal tables (that are populated once and infrequently changed) 
    - for smaller tables, especially standard tables, for ensuring uniqueness of entries (in standard tables, the primary key cannot be unique) 
    - if predominantly fast read accesses are required. Then non-unique sorted secondary table keys can be used, especially for existing internal tables because a later change of the table declaration does not affect exsisting statements.
    - if predominantly uniqueness is required. Then unique hash secondary table keys can be used. This is also true for smaller internal tables.
 - Note that defining secondary table keys involves additional administration costs such as additional memory consumption and regarding the key update
   - Unique secondary table keys are immediately updated, whereas non-unique secondary table keys are not (only when the table is accessed using the key).
   - The use of secondary table keys should be reserved for cases where the benefits outweigh the extra costs. So, it may not be advisable to use secondary table keys for very small tables or if you very often change the content of the table.
- For more details, see the programming guidelines for secondary keys: [Secondary
    Key (F1 docu for standard ABAP)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_key_guidl.htm "Guideline").

## Creating Internal Tables and Types

You can declare internal tables and internal table types in [ABAP programs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_program_glosry.htm) using the [`TYPES`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptypes.htm) and [`DATA`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdata.htm) statements. The relevant syntax elements for internal tables are `TABLE OF` in combination 
with the additions [`TYPE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdata_simple.htm)
or [`LIKE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdata_referring.htm).

``` abap
TYPES itab_type1 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF data_type ...   "Standard table type
TYPES itab_type2 LIKE SORTED   TABLE OF data_object ... "Sorted table type

DATA  itab1      TYPE          TABLE OF data_type ...   "Standard table by default
DATA  itab2      TYPE HASHED   TABLE OF data_type ...   "Hashed table
DATA  itab3      TYPE                   itab_type1 ...  "Based on an existing internal table type 
DATA  itab4      LIKE                   itab1 ...       "Based on an existing internal table       
```

> [!NOTE]  
> - If the table category is not specified (`... TYPE TABLE OF ...`), it is automatically `... TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ...`.
> - Using [Runtime Type Creation (RTTC)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrun_time_type_creation_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), you can define and  create new internal tables and table types as [type description objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentype_object_glosry.htm) at runtime. For more information, see the [Dynamic Programming](06_Dynamic_Programming.md) ABAP cheat sheet. Also find a snippet on creating internal tables dynamically by specifying the type dynamically [below](#creating-internal-tables-dynamically).

The following code snippets contain various internal table declarations. It is intended to demonstrate a selection of the rich variety of possible internal tables mentioned in the previous sections, e.g. in *Table Keys in Internal Tables*.
In the examples, many of the internal tables are created using the structured type of a demo database table in the DDIC. The line type of the database table is automatically used when defining an internal table.

### Internal Tables Based on Locally Created Line/Table Types

The examples above demonstrate internal tables that are created using the structured type of a database table in the DDIC. 
The following example shows the pattern and various examples of declaring internal tables and types by including the local definition of structured data and internal table types for demonstration purposes.

Steps: 
1. Define a structured data type (locally or globally). 
   This is not necessary if you use, for example, the name of a database table or [CDS view](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_view_glosry.htm) in the internal table declaration. In these cases their line type is used automatically.
2. Define an internal table type.
3. Create the internal table, i.e. a data object that uses this type.

You can also create an internal table by ...
- combining the data object creation and table type definition in one step. 
- using an [inline declaration](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninline_declaration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). Such inline declarations are possible at suitable [declaration
positions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeclaration_positions.htm)
if the operand type can be fully determined, for example, using a
`DATA` statement (or [`FINAL`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfinal_inline.htm) for immutable variables).


``` abap
"Internal table creation steps based on a locally declared structure
"1. Defining line type locally
TYPES: BEGIN OF ls_loc,
          key_field TYPE i,
          char1     TYPE c LENGTH 10,
          char2     TYPE c LENGTH 10,
          num1      TYPE i,
          num2      TYPE i,
        END OF ls_loc.

"2. Defining internal table types
TYPES: tt_std    TYPE TABLE OF ls_loc WITH EMPTY KEY,
        tt_sorted TYPE SORTED TABLE OF ls_loc WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY key_field,
        tt_hashed TYPE HASHED TABLE OF ls_loc WITH UNIQUE KEY key_field.

"3. Creating internal tables from locally defined table types
DATA: it22 TYPE tt_std,
      it23 TYPE tt_sorted,
      it24 TYPE tt_hashed.

"Combining data object and table type definition

### Overview of Line and Table Type Options with Internal Tables

This section explores various line and table type options when declaring internal tables. Examples have already been covered in the previous sections. Among the options are, for example: 
- Elementary line types based on elementary built-in ABAP types, locally declared elementary types, globally available elementary types such as DDIC data elements
- Line types based on both locally declared and globally available structured types
  - Among the globally available line types are, for example, DDIC structures, database tables and CDS objects such as CDS view entities
  - Note that internal tables can be created as [deep tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeep_table_glosry.htm). That is, internal tables can contain [deep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeep_glosry.htm) components (references, internal tables or strings). Structures can also be components of internal tables. For more information, see the [Variants of Structures](02_Structures.md#variants-of-structures) in the *Structures* cheat sheet.
- Table types based on both locally declared and globally available table types

## Populating Internal Tables

> [!NOTE]  
> Various ABAP statements populate internal tables. The following sections cover a selection. ABAP SQL `SELECT`  statements are covered further down and in the [ABAP SQL](03_ABAP_SQL.md) cheat sheet.

### Copying Internal Tables

To copy internal table content from one table to another, you can use the assignment operator. Such an assignment (without a constructor expression) deletes the existing content in the target internal table. The example below assumes that the source and target table have compatible line types. Using inline declaration is helpful to avoid an additional internal table declaration with an appropriate type.

``` abap
itab = itab2.

DATA(itab3) = itab.
FINAL(itab4) = itab.
```

> [!NOTE]  
> - Internal tables can only be assigned to internal tables. 
> - Internal tables can be assigned to each other if their line types are [compatible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencompatible_glosry.htm) or [convertible](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconvertible_glosry.htm).
> - An assignment can trigger an uncatchable exception if, for example, the target table is assigned a duplicate of a unique primary table key or secondary table.
> - More information: [Conversion Rules for Internal Tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconversion_itab.htm)

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Using INSERT and APPEND Statements to Populate Internal Tables

You can use the ABAP keywords
[`INSERT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapinsert_itab.htm)
and [`APPEND`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapappend.htm)
to add lines to internal tables.

<details>
  <summary>üü¢ Click to expand for notes on using <code>APPEND</code> and <code>INSERT</code></summary>
  <!-- -->

-   `APPEND` ...
    -   always adds lines at the bottom of the internal table.
    -   is not a problem for standard tables where lines are managed
        by an index. When the statement is used, the system field
        `sy-tabix` is set to the index of the recently added
        line. `sy-tabix` is always set to the index with respect
        to the primary table index.
    -   cannot be used for hashed tables. For sorted tables,
        lines are appended only if they match the sort order, and no
        duplicate entries are created if the primary table key is unique.
        Therefore, `INSERT` should be used when adding lines to
        sorted tables.
-   `INSERT` ...
    -   can be used to add lines at a specific position in tables (by
        specifying the target index). In doing so, all the following
        lines are moved down one position.
    -   without specifying the position adds the lines at the bottom of
        the table in case of standard tables. However, when using
        `INSERT`, `sy-tabix` is not set unlike
        `APPEND`. In case of sorted tables, the line is
        automatically inserted at the correct position.
    - With `INSERT`, you can specify the position in the internal table at which lines are inserted after `INTO`. 
        - `... INTO TABLE itab ...`: Line is inserted in ...
          - standard tables as last line (i.e. appended) 
          - sorted tables in the sort order in accordance with primary key values
          - hashed table by the hash administration in accordance with primary key values
        - `... INTO itab INDEX n`: Possible for index tables. The line is inserted before the line with the line number `n` in the primary table index.
    -   Note: In the case of unique primary table keys, the table cannot have entries with duplicate
        keys. If a duplicate is inserted, the insertion fails and the
        system field `sy-subrc` is set to 4.
- What to use? The recommendation is the `INSERT` statement. It covers all table and key types. Consider potential issues when you change table/key types, and you use `APPEND` in your code.

### Creating and Populating Internal Tables Using Constructor Expressions
The constructor expressions can be specified in/with various positions/statements in ABAP. In most of the following snippets, simple assignments are demonstrated.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following sections cover a selection. There are more constructor expressions used in the context of internal tables (e.g. for creating internal tables). Find more details in the [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) cheat sheet.

#### VALUE Operator
As mentioned above, table lines that are constructed inline as
arguments to the `VALUE` operator, for example, can be added to
internal tables. In the following cases, internal tables are populated
using constructor expressions in the context of
[assignments](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenassignment_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").

<td>

In the example below, the internal table is populated by assigning an
internal table that is constructed inline with the `VALUE`
operator. The inline constructed table has two lines. `line`
represents an existing structure with a compatible line type. The
other line is constructed inline.

> [!NOTE]  
> - The extra pair of parentheses represents a table line. The `#` character indicates that the line type can be derived from the context. The assignment deletes the existing content of the internal table on the left side.
> - The existing content of the internal table is deleted, and the new content, which is created in place, is added.

When you use the above assignments to an existing internal table (`itab = ...`), the internal table is initialized and the existing content is deleted. To add new lines without deleting existing content, use the  [`BASE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm) addition.

<br>

``` abap

Without the `BASE` addition, the existing content is deleted. It is assumed that the line type of the source table is compatible with that of the target table. You have multiple syntax options following the `LINES OF` addition, e.g. you can further determine and restrict the lines to be added using `FROM` and `TO`.

<td>

Using the `VALUE` operator and iteration expressions with [`FOR`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfor.htm), you can create content of an internal table by evaluating one or more source tables. The expressions are covered in the [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) cheat sheet.

[`CORRESPONDING`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm) operator. 
- Note that the existing content is deleted.
- As an alternative to the `CORRESPONDING` operator, you can use [`MOVE-CORRESPONDING`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapmove-corresponding.htm) statements. 
- The operator is particularly useful for incompatible source and target types. Value assignments are made based on identical components in the source and target. As shown further down, you can also specify mapping rules using the `MAPPING` addition.
- The example assumes that the line types of the source and target table are not compatible. However, if the line types are compatible, the syntax will also work.
- Several additions are possible. They can also be combined. Check the ABAP Keyword Documentation.

- For elementary components, the assignment is made according to the associated assignment rules.

<br>

... using the `EXCEPT` addition to the `CORRESPONDING` operator.
- This is particularly useful if there are identically named components in the source and target tables that are not compatible or convertible. You can avoid syntax errors or runtime errors. 
- Instead of a component list, `EXCEPT` can also be followed by `*` to exclude all components that are not mentioned in a previous mapping of components. 
- If `EXCEPT *` is used without the `MAPPING` addition, all components remain initial.

- The `BASE` addition does not delete the existing content. 
- See also the alternative `MOVE-CORRESPONDING` statements that use the `EXPANDING NESTED TABLES` addition.

#### FILTER Operator

To create an internal table by copying data from another internal table and 
filtering out lines that do not meet the `WHERE` condition, you can use the [`FILTER`
operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_filter.htm).

-   The
    `FILTER` operator constructs an internal table according to a specified type (which can be an explicitly specified, non-generic table type or the `#` character as a symbol for the [operand type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenoperand_type_glosry.htm) before the first parenthesis).
- The lines for the new internal table are taken from an
    existing internal table based on conditions specified in a `WHERE` clause. Note that the table type of the existing internal table must be convertible into the specified target type.
-   The conditions can be based on either single values or a [filter
    table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_filter_table.htm).
- Additions:

|Addition |Details |
|---|---|
|`USING KEY`  | Specifies the [table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") used to evaluate the `WHERE` condition: either a [sorted key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensorted_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [hash key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenhash_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"). If the internal table does not have either of these, it must have a [secondary table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), which must be specified after `USING KEY`.  |
| `EXCEPT`   | Specifying `EXCEPT` means that those lines of the existing table are used that do not meet the condition specified in the `WHERE` clause. If `EXCEPT` is not specified, those lines of the existing table that meet the condition are used.  |

Examples:
```abap
"FILTER on conditions based on single values
"Assumption: The component num is of type i.
DATA itab1 TYPE SORTED TABLE OF struc WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY num.
DATA itab2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF struc WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY sec_key COMPONENTS num.
DATA itab3 TYPE HASHED TABLE OF struc WITH UNIQUE KEY num.

"The lines meeting the condition are respected.
"Note: The source table must have at least one sorted or hashed key.
"Here, the primary key is used
DATA(f1) = FILTER #( itab1 WHERE num >= 3 ).

"USING KEY primary_key explicitly specified; same as above
DATA(f2) = FILTER #( itab1 USING KEY primary_key WHERE num >= 3 ).

"EXCEPT addition
DATA(f3) = FILTER #( itab1 EXCEPT WHERE num >= 3 ).
DATA(f4) = FILTER #( itab1 EXCEPT USING KEY primary_key WHERE num >= 3 ).

"Secondary table key specified after USING KEY
DATA(f5) = FILTER #( itab2 USING KEY sec_key WHERE num >= 4 ).
DATA(f6) = FILTER #( itab2 EXCEPT USING KEY sec_key WHERE num >= 3 ).

"Note: In case of a hash key, exactly one comparison expression for each key component is allowed;
"only = as comparison operator possible.
DATA(f7) = FILTER #( itab3 WHERE num = 3 ).

"Using a filter table
"In the WHERE condition, the columns of source and filter table are compared. 
"Those lines in the source table are used for which at least one line in the filter 
"table meets the condition. EXCEPT and USING KEY are also possible.

DATA filter_tab1 TYPE SORTED TABLE OF i
  WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY table_line.

DATA filter_tab2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF i
  WITH EMPTY KEY
  WITH UNIQUE SORTED KEY line COMPONENTS table_line.

DATA(f8) = FILTER #( itab1 IN filter_tab1 WHERE num = table_line ).

"EXCEPT addition
DATA(f9) = FILTER #( itab1 EXCEPT IN filter_tab1 WHERE num = table_line ).

"USING KEY is specified for the filter table
DATA(f10) = FILTER #( itab2 IN filter_tab2 USING KEY line WHERE num = table_line ).

"USING KEY is specified for the source table, including EXCEPT
DATA(f11) = FILTER #( itab2 USING KEY sec_key EXCEPT IN filter_tab2 WHERE num = table_line ).
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

#### NEW Operator

Using the instance operator [`NEW`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_new.htm), you can create [anonymous data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenanonymous_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), such as anonymous internal tables. You can access the lines, components or the entire data objects by [dereferencing](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendereferencing_operat_glosry.htm). For more information, refer to the  [Dynamic Programming](06_Dynamic_Programming.md) and [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) cheat sheets.

```abap
TYPES: BEGIN OF s,
          a TYPE c LENGTH 3,
          b TYPE i,
        END OF s,
        tab_type TYPE TABLE OF s WITH EMPTY KEY.

"Creating and populating an anonymous data object
DATA(dref_tab) = NEW tab_type( ( a = 'aaa' b = 1 )
                               ( a = 'bbb' b = 2 ) ).

"Access by dereferencing
DATA(copy_deref_itab) = dref_tab->*.
DATA(read_line) = dref_tab->*[ 2 ].
DATA(read_comp) = dref_tab->*[ 1 ]-a.
dref_tab->*[ 1 ]-a = 'zzz'.
ASSERT dref_tab->*[ 1 ]-a = 'zzz'.
INSERT VALUE s( a = 'yyy' b = 3 ) INTO TABLE dref_tab->*.

### Example: Exploring Populating Internal Tables

Expand the following collapsible section for example code. To try it out, create a demo class named `zcl_demo_abap` and paste the code into it. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. 
The example is set up to display output in the console, but only for few data objects. You may want to set a break point at the earliest possible position and walk through the example in the debugger. This will allow you to double-click on data objects and observe how the different statements affect their contents.

## Reading Single Lines from Internal Tables

There are three different ways to specify the line to read:

- by index (only index tables)
- by table keys (only tables for which a key is defined)
- by free key

The following code snippets include [`READ TABLE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapread_table.htm) statements and [table expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_expressions.htm) to read from internal tables.
Note that you can also use ABAP SQL `SELECT` statements to read from internal tables. This is covered further down.

### Determining the Target Area when Reading Single Lines in READ TABLE Statements

<table>

<tr>
<td> Target Area </td> <td> Notes </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 

Data object

 </td>

 <td> 

- Used to copy a line to a data object using the addition `INTO`.
- After the copying, the line found exists separately in the internal table and in the data object. 
- If you change the data object or the table line, the change does not affect the other. 
- However, you can modify the copied table line and use a `MODIFY` statement to modify the table based on the modified table line (see below). 
- The `TRANSPORTING` addition specifies which components to copy. If it is not specified, all components are respected.
    
<br>

``` abap
"dobj must have the table's structure type
READ TABLE itab INTO dobj ...   

READ TABLE itab INTO DATA(dobj_inl) ...

READ TABLE itab INTO ... TRANSPORTING comp1 [comp2 ... ].
```

 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 

Field symbol

 </td>

 <td> 

- Assigning a line to a [field symbol](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
  for example, using an inline declaration (`... ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) ...`). 
- When you then access the field symbol, it means that you access the found table line. There is no actual copying of content. Therefore, modifying the field symbol means
    modifying the table line directly. 
- Note that you cannot use the `TRANSPORTING` addition since the entire table is assigned to the field symbol.

<br>

``` abap
"The field symbol must have an appropriate type.
READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING <fs1> ...                 

"Inline declaration
READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs2>) ...   
```

 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 

Data reference variable

 </td>

 <td> 

- Reading a line into a [data reference variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_reference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") using `REFERENCE INTO`. 
- In this case, no copying takes place. 
- If you want to address the line, you must first [dereference](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendereferencing_operat_glosry.htm) the data reference. 
- You cannot use the addition `TRANSPORTING`.

<br>

``` abap
"The data reference variable must have an appropriate type.
READ TABLE itab REFERENCE INTO dref ...

"Inline declaration
READ TABLE itab REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref_inl) ...
```

 </td>
</tr>

</table>

> [!TIP]
> Which to use then? Since all syntax options basically provide similar
functionality, your use case, the
performance or readability of the code may play a role. For more information, see 
the programming guidelines for the [target
area (F1 docu for standard ABAP)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_output_guidl.htm "Guideline").
A use case for `INTO dobj` is when the table should
not be changed using the copied table line. However, copying comes
at a performance cost. Imagine that your table contains many columns or
nested components. In this case, it is better not to copy at all (although you can use 
the `TRANSPORTING` addition to restrict the fields to be copied).

### Reading Single Lines by Index

<table>
<tr>
<td> Statement </td> <td> Details/Code Snippet </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>READ TABLE</code> </td>
<td>

The following example shows `READ TABLE` statements to read a single line from an internal table by specifying the index. You can use the addition `USING KEY` to specify a table key and thus explicitly determine the table index to use. If the table has a sorted secondary
key, the addition can be specified and the line to be read is then determined from its secondary table index. If the primary table key is
specified by its name `primary_key`, the table must be an index table, and the behavior is the same as if `USING KEY` was
not specified.
Note that the examples only show reading into a work area. Other targets are possible as shown above. 

<br>

``` abap
"Primary table index is used by default
READ TABLE itab INTO wa INDEX i.

"Primary table index is used, primary key's default name specified explicitly 
READ TABLE itab INTO wa INDEX i USING KEY primary_key.

"Secondary table index is used (assuming a secondary table key sec_key exists) 
READ TABLE itab INTO wa INDEX i USING KEY sec_key.

"Note: You can also use alias names for the keys if specified.
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Table expressions </td>
<td>

Using [table
expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_expressions.htm),
the read result is stored in a variable that can be declared inline.
The number in the square brackets represents the index. A line that is
not found results in an runtime error. To avoid an error, you can
use a [`TRY ... CATCH ... ENDTRY.`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaptry.htm) block.

Find more information about syntax related to table expressions [further down](#table-expressions).
<br>

``` abap
"In the examples, integer values are specified for the index.
DATA(lv1) = itab[ 1 ].

TRY.
  DATA(lv2) = itab[ 2 ].
  CATCH cx_sy_itab_line_not_found.
  ...
ENDTRY.

DATA(lv3) = itab[ KEY primary_key INDEX 3 ].

"Copying a table line via table expression and embedding in constructor expression
DATA(lv4) = VALUE #( itab[ 4 ] ).

"Reading into data reference variable using the REF operator
DATA(lv5_ref) = REF #( itab[ 5 ] ).
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Avoiding an exception when using table expressions </td>
<td>

When you read a non-existent line using a table expression, you may not want to throw an exception. You can also embed the table expression
in a constructor expression using the `OPTIONAL` addition. This way, an unsuccessful read will not trigger the 
exception. The result returned is a line with initial values.
Alternatively, you can use the `DEFAULT` addition to return a
default line in case of an unsuccessful read operation, which can also be another table expression or constructor expression.

<br>

``` abap
DATA(line1) = VALUE #( itab[ 6 ] OPTIONAL ).

DATA(line2) = VALUE #( itab[ 7 ] DEFAULT itab[ 1 ]  ).
DATA(line3) = VALUE #( itab[ 8 ] DEFAULT VALUE #( ) ).

### Examples of Addressing Individual Components of Read Lines

When reading single lines in general, you can also address individual
components of the line using the [component
selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencomponent_selector_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
`-` (or the [object component selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenobject_component_select_glosry.htm) `->` or the [dereferencing
operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendereferencing_operat_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
`->*` in the case of data reference variables).

You can also use [`ASSIGN`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapassign.htm) statements to assign components (and more) to [field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm). See the [Example: Exploring READ TABLE Statements and Table Expressions](#example-exploring-read-table-statements-and-table-expressions) below.

``` abap
DATA(comp1) = it[ b = 2 ]-c.

READ TABLE it INTO DATA(wa) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp2) = wa-c.

READ TABLE it ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp3) = <fs>-c.

READ TABLE it REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp4) = dref->c.

"It is also possible to specify the dereferencing operator
"with the component selector.
DATA(comp5) = dref->*-c.

"Note: When using field symbols and data reference variables as target areas, 
"and you modify their content (the examples above only show reads), you can directly 
"edit the line in the internal table (because the field symbols/data reference 
"variable points to the line). This does not apply to work areas that creates 
"local copies. However, you can modify the content of the work area and then, 
"for example, use a MODIFY statement to edit the line in the internal table as 
"shown further down. 
```

### Excursions with READ TABLE Statements

#### System Field Setting in READ TABLE Statements
- For example, for checking if a line is found (`sy-subrc`) and stored in the target area, and what the index of the line is (`sy-tabix`). 
- Find more information [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapread_table.htm)

```abap
TYPES: BEGIN OF demo_struc,
          comp1 TYPE i,
          comp2 TYPE c LENGTH 3,
        END OF demo_struc,
        ty_tab_demo TYPE TABLE OF demo_struc WITH EMPTY KEY.

DATA(it) = VALUE ty_tab_demo( ( comp1 = 1 comp2 = `abc` )
                              ( comp1 = 2 comp2 = `def` )
                              ( comp1 = 1 comp2 = `ghi` ) ).

READ TABLE it INTO DATA(wa) WITH KEY comp2 = `def`.

IF sy-subrc = 0.
  ... "line found (which is the case in the example)
ELSE.
  ... "line not found
ENDIF.

ASSERT sy-tabix = 2.

READ TABLE it INTO wa WITH KEY comp2 = `xyz`.
ASSERT sy-subrc = 4.
ASSERT sy-tabix = 0.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

#### Specifying a WHERE Condition in READ TABLE Statements

- The syntax `READ TABLE ... WHERE ...` searches for the first line that matches a `WHERE` condition.
- The value of `sy-tabix` is set when a line is found, while `sy-subrc` is set to either 0 or 4.
- The `WHERE` condition can use comparison and predicate expressions (see the code snippet comments below for examples).
- Syntax options: 
  - The read result must be specified before the `WHERE` condition.
  - The `TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS` and `USING KEY` additions are possible.
  - Dynamic `WHERE` conditions are possible.
- If a `READ TABLE` statement can be expressed using `WITH KEY`, this approach - instead of using a `WHERE` condition - is recommended as it is more performant. A syntax warning occurs but can be suppressed with the pragma `##read_where_ok`.
- For optimized searches with a `WHERE` condition:
  - No optimized search in standard tables without a secondary table key.
  - For sorted and hashed keys (sorted/hashed tables, secondary table keys), the search is optimized as described [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenitab_where_optimization.htm), if specifications are transferable to a key access.

#### COMPARING and TRANSPORTING Additions: Comparing Fields and Specifying Fields for Transport

`... TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS`: It is only checked whether the line exists. No target area is specified. As mentioned above, the system fields are filled.

#### BINARY SEARCH Addition: Optimized Read Access When Specifying Free Keys

You may stumble on the `BINARY SEARCH` addition to `READ TABLE` statements for an optimized access. However, it is recommended to use sorted tables or secondary table keys for an optimized access. Find information and an example in the expandable section below.

```abap
READ TABLE itab WITH KEY ... BINARY SEARCH ...
```

  <!-- -->

- `READ TABLE` without `BINARY SEARCH`: Table is accessed linearly
- `READ TABLE` with `BINARY SEARCH`: Table is accessed using a binary search 
  - Using the `BINARY SEARCH` addition is particularly more efficient for larger tables when accessing data often. 
  - The table must be sorted in ascending order based on the keys being searched. 
  - `BINARY SEARCH` is suitable for standard tables that do not have a secondary key defined and when you need to make multiple read accesses to the table (however, note the costs of a previous sorting)  
  - `BINARY SEARCH` can only be used with index tables and not with hashed tables. If the table is a sorted table and the read access uses a free key, the addition can only be applied when the initial part of the table key is specified. I.e. if key components are `a`, `b`, and `c`, the addition can be used by specifying `a` alone, `a` and `b`, or `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, it means that the syntax can be specified without errors. The `BINARY SEARCH` specifiation has no effect and is redundant. Syntactically not possible with `BINARY SEARCH` (for example): `b` and `c` without `a`, or any other non-key component (because it cannot be sorted according to the non-key component). 
- Depending on the number of times you need to access the internal table, it is recommended to work with sorted tables or tables with secondary keys. If you only need to read one or a few data sets, consider the administrative costs of setting up the index.
- Note: The `BINARY SEARCH` addition is not available for table expressions. If `KEY ...` is specified, an optimized search is performed by default. There are no performance differences between using the `READ TABLE` statement and table expressions.

To try it out the following example, create a demo class named `zcl_demo_abap` and paste the code into it. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. The example is set up to display output in the console.

The example includes multiple reads on standard internal tables using a `READ TABLE` statement ...
- without `BINARY SEARCH`. 
- with `BINARY SEARCH` and a previous `SORT` statement.
- with a secondary table key whose components correspond to free key used in the previous statements.
The runtime of the reads is determined and stored in internal tables. The read operations are repeated several times to have a more accurate runtime evaluation. The fastest time is output. 
The example is intended to demonstrate the performance gain using the `BINARY SEARCH` addition (and also using a secondary table key).

## Accessing Single Table Lines via Table Expressions

The previous sections also covered table expressions. This section provides a summary of their use.

- Table expressions typically use the name of an internal table followed by square brackets with content `[ ... ]`, specifying a table line.
- They allow read and write access to internal tables at various positions.
- These expressions are a concise form of `READ TABLE` statements, enabling read and write operations in operand positions.
  - Unlike `READ TABLE`, table expressions do not change the `sy-tabix` system field (except with `ASSIGN`).
- After the brackets, you can specify chaining (component and object component selectors or additional square brackets). Without chaining, the entire line is respected.
- Note that not found lines raise the catchable exception `CX_SY_ITAB_LINE_NOT_FOUND`.

The following table demonstrates a selection of subjects where table expressions are applicable.


<table>
<tr>
<td> Subject </td> <td> Details/Code Snippet </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Reading table lines by index </td>
<td>

- When only specifying the index number in the square brackets, it means referring to the primary table index.
- In this case, the internal table must be an index table.
- Using the `KEY ... INDEX ...` addition, you can specify the table index explicitly. Either use the predefined name `primary_key` for the primary key explicitly (or an alias name, if specified), or the secondary key name (or an alias name, if specified).
- The `KEY` addition here works like `USING KEY` in `READ TABLE` statements.
- Note that the demo internal tables in the snippet are used in the following examples of the section.

- `TABLE KEY` addition
  - Requires the table key to be fully specified, i.e. all components of the key (primary table key or secondary table key) must be specified, and no other components can be specified.
  - Works like the `WITH TABLE KEY` addition in `READ TABLE` statements. However, in table expressions, the `COMPONENTS` addition is optional and the key name must be specified.
  - Usually, specifying the primary table key explicitly (using predefined name `primary_key` or an alias, if available) is not required. You can instead also just specify a free key search (i.e. not using any `TABLE KEY`/`KEY` addition) and specify all primary table key components. Then, an optimized search is also performed for sorted and hashed tables. 
- `KEY` addition without `TABLE`:
  - This syntax option reads a line in accordance with a specified free key. 
  - It is not mandatory to specify all components of a sorted table key (the initial left part at least is required). The search is then partly optimized (unlike fully optimized when all key components are specified).
  - Example purposes of such a specification: Determining the existence of a line, or determining a line number for the starting point for a loop starting at that position.
  - Additionally, in case of sorted and secondary table keys, other components not being part of the key can be specified.
  - Same as above, specifying the addition `COMPONENTS` is optional.
  - Just using `KEY` and specifying all key components following the key name works like specifying `TABLE KEY`. The `TABLE KEY` addition just ensures that indeed all key components are specified. 
- Not using any `TABLE KEY`/`KEY` additions:
  - In case of sorted and hashed tables and without using any `TABLE KEY`/`KEY` additions, an optimized search is performed when some or all components of the primary table key are specified as free keys.
- Notes:
  - Binary searches cannot be enforced with table expressions (unlike `READ TABLE` statements).
  - Key names can also be specified dynamically using parentheses `(...)`.

- The following example emphasizes that table expressions - expression enabling in modern ABAP as such - comes in very handy. 
- However, also take the maintainability, debuggability and readbility of your code into consideration. 
- The example includes the table expression chaining example from above (that may be fairly hard to understand) and a nonsensical, bad example overusing table expressions (affecting performance).
- Expand the following collapsible section for example code. To try it out, create a demo class named `zcl_demo_abap` and paste the code into it. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. The example is set up to display output in the console.

## Processing Multiple Internal Table Lines Sequentially

If you are interested not only in single table lines, but in the entire
table content or in specific parts of it, you can use [`LOOP
AT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab.htm)
statements to process table lines sequentially. As above, you
can use multiple options for target areas: work area, field
symbol, data reference. There are multiple additions to the `LOOP AT`
statements to further restrict the table content to be processed.

Simple form:
``` abap
"The target is an existing work area.
DATA wa LIKE LINE OF it.

LOOP AT it INTO wa. 
  "No addition of the loop statement; all lines are processed
  "Statements in this block are relevant for each individual table line.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Work area declared inline
LOOP AT itab INTO DATA(wa_inl).
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Field symbols
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> LIKE LINE OF it.

LOOP AT it ASSIGNING <fs>.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

LOOP AT it ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs_inl>).
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Data reference variables
DATA dref TYPE REF TO dbtab.

LOOP AT it REFERENCE INTO dref.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

LOOP AT it REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref_inl).
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Table key specification (snippet uses example table from above)
"The specified table key affects the order in which the table lines
"are accessed and the evaluation of the other conditions.

LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY primary_key.
"LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY pk.            "primary key alias
"LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY sec_key.       "secondary key
"LOOP AT it INTO wa USING KEY sk.            "secondary key alias
  ...
ENDLOOP.
```

- The order in which tables are iterated depends on the table category. 
  - Note the [`STEP`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_cond.htm#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@) addition, which is also available for other ABAP statements.  
- Index tables are looped over in ascending order by the index. 
- Hashed tables are looped in the order in which the lines were added to the table. You can also sort the table before the loop. 
- During the loop, the system field `sy-tabix` is set to the number of the currently processed table
line. This is not true for hashed tables. There, `sy-tabix` is `0`. 
- Note that if you want to work with the value of `sy-tabix`, you
should do so immediately after the `LOOP` statement (e.g. by storing the value in a helper variable) to avoid possible overwriting in statements contained in the loop block.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Restricting the Area of a Table to Be Looped Over

The additions of `LOOP` statements come into play when you want to restrict the table content to be respected by the loop because
you do not want to loop over the entire table. Note that the examples only show work areas as target objects to hold the table line read. 
Other options are possible as shown above.

``` abap
"FROM/TO: Only for index tables

"Specifying an index range
LOOP AT it INTO wa FROM 2 TO 5.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"From specified line until the end
LOOP AT it INTO wa FROM 2.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"From first line until the specified line
LOOP AT it INTO wa TO 5.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"WHERE clause: Restricting lines based on logical expression

LOOP AT it INTO wa WHERE a > 1 AND b < 4.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"No interest in the table content; only relevant system fields are populated

"Mandatory WHERE clause
LOOP AT it TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS WHERE a < 5.
  ...
ENDLOOP.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Defining the Step Size and the Direction of Loop Passes

Find more information in the [`STEP`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_cond.htm#!ABAP_ADDITION_3@3@) topic. The addition is also available for other ABAP statements.  

``` abap
"STEP addition for defining the step size and the direction of the loop
"- Step size: Specified by the absolute value of an integer
"- Direction: Specified by a positive (forward loop) or negative 
"  (loop in reverse order) integer 

"Reversing the loop order using a negative integer
"Each line is read indicated by the absolute value 1
LOOP AT it INTO wa STEP -1.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"Forward loop by specifiying a positive integer
"In the example, every second line is read.
"Note: Omitting STEP means STEP 1 by default.
LOOP AT it INTO wa STEP 2.
  ...
ENDLOOP.

"STEP with other additions
"The example uses the additions FROM and TO.
"Note: If the value after STEP is negative, the value
"after FROM must be greater than the value after TO.
LOOP AT it INTO wa FROM 6 TO 3 STEP -2.
  ...
ENDLOOP.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Iteration Expressions

Iteration expressions with [`FOR`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfor.htm) as part of certain constructor expressions allow you to create content of an internal table by evaluating one or more source tables.

```abap
TYPES ty_int_tab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(int_table_a) = VALUE ty_int_tab( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ).
DATA int_table_b TYPE ty_int_tab.
int_table_b = VALUE #( FOR wa_b IN int_table_a ( wa_b * 2 ) ).
"Table Content: 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10

"Instead of, for example, a LOOP statement as follows:
DATA int_table_c TYPE ty_int_tab.
LOOP AT int_table_a INTO DATA(wa_c).
  INSERT wa_c * 3 INTO TABLE int_table_c.
ENDLOOP.
"Table content: 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15
```

The expressions are covered in the [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) cheat sheet:
- [Iteration Expressions Using FOR](05_Constructor_Expressions.md#iteration-expressions-using-for)
- Special reduction operator `REDUCE` that is based on iteration expressions: [REDUCE](05_Constructor_Expressions.md#reduce)

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Interrupting and Exiting Loops

ABAP keywords such as 
- `CONTINUE` (terminating the current loop pass, continuing with the next)
- `CHECK` (conditional termination termination of the current loop pass if the logical expression is false), and 
- `EXIT` (loop terminated completely), 

are available to exit and interrupt loops. Find more information in the [Program Flow Logic](13_Program_Flow_Logic.md#interrupting-and-exiting-loops) cheat sheet.

In the following example, the loop is exited using the `EXIT` statement when a certain condition is met.
```abap
DATA(str_table) = VALUE string_table( ( `a` ) ( `b` ) ( `c` ) ( `d` ) ( `e` ) ( `f` ) ).
LOOP AT str_table INTO DATA(wa).
  DATA(tabix) = sy-tabix.
  IF wa = `e`.
    EXIT.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.
ASSERT tabix = 5.
```    

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Inserting and Deleting Lines in Internal Tables in Loops

- In a loop, you can change the values of the current table line's components. You can also delete or insert entire lines.
- The position of these new or deleted lines is determined by the table index or a sorted key. For hashed tables or hash keys, the position is determined by the insertion order (though this can be changed with the `SORT` statement).
- After the currently processed table line, ...
  - inserting a line: The new line is processed in the next loop pass (watch out for a non-terminating loop).
  - deleting a line: The deleted line is not processed in the next loop pass.
- Before the currently processed table line, ...
  - inserting a line: The internal loop counter (`sy-tabix`) increases accordingly (in the case of index tables, sorted keys).
  - deleting a line: The internal loop counter (`sy-tabix`) decreases accordingly.
- You cannot replace or clear the entire table body in a loop. If detected statically, a syntax error is displayed.

The following examples explore the insertion and deletion of lines when looping across internal tables: 

```abap

"work with in the example loops

## Modifying Internal Table Content

As mentioned above, you can modify the content of internal table lines directly in the context of `READ TABLE` and `LOOP AT` statements using field symbols and data reference variables. You can also use table expressions for direct modification (as also covered in section [Table Expressions](#table-expressions)). Note that the key fields of the primary table key of sorted and hashed tables are always read-only. If you try to modify a key field, a runtime error occurs. However, this is not checked until runtime.

### Modifying Read Table Lines

The following examples demonstrate direct modification of recently read table lines:

### Modifying Table Lines Using ABAP MODIFY Statements

[`MODIFY`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapmodify_itab.htm)
statements provide multiple ways of changing the content of single and multiple table lines by specifying the table key or a table index,
without first reading the lines into a target area. Do not confuse the ABAP statement `MODIFY` with the ABAP SQL statement [`MODIFY`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/ABAPMODIFY_DBTAB.html).

``` abap
"Addition FROM ...; specified key values determine the line to be modified

"line: existing line including key values
MODIFY TABLE it FROM line.

"line constructed inline
MODIFY TABLE it FROM VALUE #( a = 1 b = 2 ... ).

"Respecting only specified fields with the addition TRANSPORTING
"In case of sorted/hashed tables, key values cannot be specified.
MODIFY TABLE it FROM line TRANSPORTING b c.

"Modification via index
"Note that it is only MODIFY, not MODIFY TABLE.
"Example: It modifies the line with number 1 in the primary table index.
MODIFY it FROM line INDEX 1.

"Without the addition TRANSPORTING, the entire line is changed.
"Example: It modifies specific values.
MODIFY it FROM line INDEX 1 TRANSPORTING b c.

"USING KEY addition
"If the addition is not specified, the primary table key is used;
"otherwise, it is the explicitly specified table key that is used.
"Example: It is the same as MODIFY it FROM line INDEX 1.
MODIFY it FROM line USING KEY primary_key INDEX 1.

"The statement below uses a secondary key and an index specification
"for the secondary table index. Only specific fields are modified.
MODIFY it FROM line USING KEY sec_key INDEX 1 TRANSPORTING c d.

"Modifying multiple lines in internal tables
"All lines matching the logical expression in the WHERE clause are modified
"as specified in line.
"The additions TRANSPORTING and WHERE are both mandatory; USING KEY is optional.
MODIFY it FROM line TRANSPORTING b c WHERE a < 5.
```

> [!NOTE] 
> - The system field `sy-subrc` is set to `0` if at least one line was changed. It is set to `4` if no lines were changed.
> - `MODIFY`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` statements can be specified with and without the `TABLE` addition. With `TABLE` means an index access. Without `TABLE` means an access via the table key.

## Deleting Internal Table Content

You can use [`DELETE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdelete_itab.htm) statements to delete single and multiple lines in internal tables. The following additions can be used: `USING KEY` (for specifying a table key), `FROM`/`TO` (for specifying row ranges), `STEP` (for specifying the step size), and `WHERE` (for specifying conditions).

``` abap
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*& Deleting via index 
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*

"Example: The first line in the table is deleted.
DELETE it INDEX 1.

"If USING KEY is not used, INDEX can only be used with index tables.
"If doing so, it determines the line from the primary table index.
"If a secondary key is specified, the secondary table index is respected
"Example: same as above
DELETE it INDEX 1 USING KEY primary_key.

"Deleting an index range; FROM or TO alone can also be specified
DELETE it FROM 2 TO 5.

*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*& Deleting via keys
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*

"The line must have a compatible type to the tables line type and
"include key values. The first found line with the corresponding keys
"is deleted.
"If the key is empty, no line is deleted.
DELETE TABLE it FROM line.

"Instead of specifying the keys using a data object ("line" above),
"the keys can be specified separately. All key values must be specified.
"Example: Respects keys from primary table index.
DELETE TABLE it WITH TABLE KEY a = 1.

"You can also specify secondary keys.
"Example: Same as above
DELETE TABLE it WITH TABLE KEY primary_key COMPONENTS a = 1.

DELETE TABLE it_sec WITH TABLE KEY sec_key COMPONENTS ...

*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*& Deleting multiple lines based on a WHERE condition
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*

"Specifying the additions USING KEY, FROM, TO is also possible.
DELETE it WHERE a < 6.

"Excursion: Deleting in a LIKE-like fashion you may know from
"ABAP SQL statements.
"The LIKE addition is not available for the WHERE clause in DELETE
"statements for internal tables as is the case for ABAP SQL DELETE statements.
DATA(str_table) = VALUE string_table( ( `abcZ` ) ( `Zdef` ) ( `gZhi` ) 
                                      ( `Zjkl` ) ( `Zmno` ) ( `pqrZ` ) ).    

"You can, for example, use logical operators such as CP (conforms to pattern)
"All lines that begin with Z are to be deleted.
DELETE str_table WHERE table_line CP `Z*`.
"Result: abcZ / gZhi / pqrZ

*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*& Deleting the current line inside a LOOP statement
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*

"The following example illustrates deleting the current table line
"using a DELETE statement within a LOOP statement. Lines with even
"numbers are deleted.
"Note:
"- The short form of the DELETE statement always deletes the
"  current first line implicitly. It is only possible within a LOOP
"  statement and the delete operation is performed on the same internal
"  table.
"- The field symbol (or reference variable) should not be used after
"  the DELETE statement any more.
DATA itab1 TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
itab1 = VALUE #( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ).

LOOP AT itab1 ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>).
  IF <fs> MOD 2 = 0.
    DELETE itab1.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.

*Table content:
*1
*3
*5
*7
*9

"The following, similar example (uneven numbers are deleted) uses a
"table which is looped over by specifying the addition USING KEY.
"In this case (using LOOP ... USING KEY ...), the short form of the
"DELETE statement cannot be used. Use the DELETE statement with the
"addition USING KEY loop_key to delete the current first line.
"loop_key is a predefined name to be used with DELETE and within
"loops that specify LOOP ... USING KEY .... No other key name is
"possible here.
DATA itab2 TYPE TABLE OF i WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY table_line.
itab2 = VALUE #( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ).

LOOP AT itab2 USING KEY primary_key REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref2).
  IF dref2->* MOD 2 <> 0.
    DELETE itab2 USING KEY loop_key.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.

*Table content:
*2
*4
*6
*8
*10
```

### Deleting Adjacent Duplicate Lines

`DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES` statements allow you to delete all adjacent lines except for the first line that have the same content in certain components. You usually need to perform some appropriate sorting before using these statements.

``` abap
"Implicitly using the primary table key
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it.

"Deletion respecting the values of the entire line
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it COMPARING ALL FIELDS.

"Only lines are deleted with matching content in specific fields
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it COMPARING a c.

"Deletion respecting a specified table key
"Same as first example above
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it USING KEY primary_key.

DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM it USING KEY sec_key.
```

> [!NOTE] 
> The system field `sy-subrc` is set to `0` if at least one line has been deleted. It is set to `4` if no lines were deleted.

### Deleting the Entire Internal Table Content

The 
[`CLEAR`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapclear.htm)
and
[`FREE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapfree_dataobject.htm)
statements allow you to delete the entire table content.

The difference between the two is in the handling of the memory space originally allocated to the table. When a table is cleared with `CLEAR`,
the content is removed, but the memory space initially requested remains
allocated. If the table is populated again later, the memory space is still
available, which is a performance advantage over 
clearing an internal table with `FREE`. Such a statement also
deletes the table content, but it also releases the memory
space. 
Note that an assignment using the `VALUE` operator without entries in the parentheses clears the internal table. 

``` abap
CLEAR it.

"This statement additionally releases memory space.
FREE it.

"Assignment using the VALUE operator without entries in the parentheses
it = VALUE #( ). 

"The same applies to data reference variables pointing to internal tables.
it_ref = NEW #( ).
```
<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

## Sorting Internal Tables

-   Sorted tables are stored in the memory in an automatically sorted
    order, hence, they cannot be sorted explicitly with
    [`SORT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapsort_itab.htm).
-   For standard and hashed tables, the order can be changed.
-   When using `SORT` statements, the sort order is derived either
    by the primary table key (Note: Secondary keys
    cannot be used for the sorting.) or by explicitly specifying the
    fields to be sorted by.
-   Explicit specification is the recommended way because it is
    easier to understand and can prevent unwanted sorting results,
    especially with tables with standard key.
- Note that sorting is unstable by default concerning preserving the order of table lines with identical sort keys. Sorting results can vary if the table is sorted multiple times.
- You can also sort dynamically. For more information, refer to the [Dynamic Programming](06_Dynamic_Programming.md) cheat sheet.


<table>
<tr>
<td> Subject </td> <td> Details/Code Snippet </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Sorting by primary table key </td>
<td>

``` abap
"Implicit sorting by primary table key and in ascending order by default
SORT itab.

"Optional additions to determine the sort order
"As mentioned above, ASCENDING is used implicitly. Here, specifying it explicitly.
SORT itab ASCENDING.
SORT itab DESCENDING.
```

The effect of sorting can have an unexpected result if you use the simple form of the statement and do not explicitly specify the keys. If an internal table has a structured line type and (perhaps inadvertently) the standard key as the primary table key, that is, all character-like and byte-like components make up the primary table key, all these components are taken into account when the table is sorted.
``` abap
"Is basically the same as it2
DATA it1 TYPE TABLE OF zdemo_abap_fli.

DATA it2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF zdemo_abap_fli WITH DEFAULT KEY.

"Respecting the standard key when sorting
SORT it1.
```
Plus: Suppose there are only elementary numeric components in an internal table with a structured line type. In this case, sorting has no effect because the primary table key is considered empty. This is also applies to tables declared with `EMPTY KEY`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Sorting by explicitly specifying components </td>
<td>

You can sort by any component of the internal table. It is also possible to specify the sort order 
(even component-wise). Explicitly specifying the components has the advantage that your code is easier to understand and you can avoid unexpected results if you accidentally use `SORT` without the `BY` addition on empty and standard table keys.

<br>

``` abap
DATA it3 TYPE TABLE OF struc WITH NON-UNIQUE KEY a.

"Sorting by primary table key a
SORT itab.

"Specifying the component to sort for; here, it is the same as the key;
"this way, the sorting is easier to understand
SORT itab BY a.

"Syntax showing multiple component sorting with component-wise sort order
SORT itab BY a b ASCENDING c DESCENDING.

"Sorting respecting the entire line (e. g. in the context of tables with
"empty or standard keys)
SORT itab BY table_line.
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Stable sorting </td>
<td>

By default, the sorting is unstable concerning preserving the order of table lines with identical sort keys. To ensure a stable sorting with preserving the order of table lines with identical 
sort keys, you can use the `STABLE` addition.<br><br>
This code example explores the difference in sorting results when using `STABLE` versus not using it with the `SORT` statement. A `SELECT` statement retrieves data from an internal table, specifying an `ORDER BY` clause for two columns. `SORT` statements sort the internal table. Using `STABLE` demonstrates that the relative order of the columns specified in the `ORDER BY` clause is preserved. Without `STABLE`, this relative order is not necessarily maintained. The `CL_ABAP_DIFF` class is used to compare the internal table content.

## Grouping Internal Tables

To group internal tables, there are additions for `LOOP AT` statements.

`LOOP AT ... GROUP BY` 
- Groups the lines of internal tables based on a group key. Each group key represents a group, and the lines read are members of that group. 
- Performs a loop across these groups. 
- You can execute a nested loop across the members of each group using `LOOP AT GROUP` statements.
- The statements offer a variety of syntax options, such as the following. For more information, refer to the ABAP Keyword Documentation:

  - `ASCENDING`/`DESCENDING` additions to specify the sort order in the group loop. You can also sort beforehand with `SORT` statements. 
  - `WITHOUT MEMBERS`: This creates groups (requiring group key binding) without assigning actual component values. Access to group lines is not possible. Use this when access is not necessary and you want to enhance read performance. 
  - Specifying the group key after `GROUP BY` 
    - This can be a single data object or multiple keys within parentheses, which define a structure with specific components. 
    - In simple cases, component values of the table line can be assigned to the group key or the components of the group key. However, expressions are also possible on the right side of the group key assignments. 
    - Storing group-specific information in structured group keys.     
      - `GROUP SIZE` to count group members, e.g., `gs = GROUP SIZE`. 
      - `GROUP INDEX` to index group members, e.g., `gi = GROUP INDEX`. 
      - You can choose component names (such as `gs` and `gi` in the previous example) freely. 
      - To use these components, you need a group key binding. 
  - Group key binding 
    - Can be specified at the end of the statement using `INTO` and a data object. You can also use data references (`REFERENCE INTO`) or field symbols (`ASSIGNING ...`). 
    - If specified, the current key's group key is assigned to the specified data object (data reference, or field symbol). You can then address the group in nested loops with `LOOP AT GROUP`. 
    - Note: You can access the read result (e.g., `dobj` in `LOOP AT itab INTO dobj`), but the component values are initial when the group key binding is specified. You can address the group and its component values in nested loops with `LOOP AT GROUP`. 
    - If you do not specify the group key binding, it defaults to a representative binding. In each loop pass, the first line of the current group is assigned to the target area. You can process this *representative* further in nested loops with `LOOP AT GROUP`. With representative binding, the `sy-tabix` value is set as if the loop was specified without grouping.

`LOOP AT GROUP`: 
- Allows for a nested loop across group members. 
- Only applicable with `LOOP ... GROUP BY` statements (provided `WITHOUT MEMBERS` is not specified) 
- After using `LOOP AT GROUP`, you can specify ... 
  - the read result that serves as a representative in representative binding: `LOOP AT it INTO DATA(wa) GROUP BY ... LOOP AT GROUP wa ...`. 
  - the group key binding: `LOOP AT it INTO DATA(wa) GROUP BY ... INTO DATA(gkb). ... LOOP AT GROUP gkb ...`. 
- Additional syntax options like a `WHERE` condition and further grouping are also available.

More information:
- [ABAP Keyword Documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by.htm)   
- Iteration expressions can also handle table grouping (`FOR ... IN GROUP`). For example, see the [Constructor Expressions](05_Constructor_Expressions.md) cheat sheet.
- [Internal Tables: Grouping](11_Internal_Tables_Grouping.md) cheat sheet 

The example class below demonstrates internal table grouping options. To try it out, create a demo class named `zcl_demo_abap` and paste the following code into it. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. The example is designed to display results in the console.

## Collecting Values

- You can use `COLLECT` statements, for example, to add the values of numeric components to the corresponding values in an internal table. 
- It is recommended that you use it mainly for internal tables with a unique primary key, especially hashed tables.
- Find more information [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapcollect.htm)

``` abap
"This example demonstrates how to insert data from a database table
"into an internal table in a compressed way. Within a SELECT loop,
"a COLLECT statement is used to consolidate lines with identical
"primary key components (carrid and connid) by summing the number
"of occupied seats in the numeric component (seatsocc).
"Additionally, an internal table is filled by adding all read lines.
"This table is looped across to simulate the effect of the COLLECT
"statement.

## Getting Information about Internal Tables, Table Lines, Table Types

### Checking the Existence of a Line in an Internal Table

This is relevant if you are not interested in the content of a table
line, but only want to find out whether a line exists that matches to the
index or key specifications. To do this, use a [`READ TABLE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapread_table.htm)
statement with the `TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS` addition. The
addition indicates that no actual content is to be read. If the search was
successful and an entry exists, the system field `sy-subrc` is
set to 0.

A newer way to check the existence of a line is the [predicate
function](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenpredicate_function_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
[`line_exists( )`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenline_exists_function.htm).
This function expects a [table
expression](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") as an argument.
See below for more on table expressions. Note that table expressions do not set system fields.
``` abap
"Read using a key
READ TABLE it WITH KEY b = 2 TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.

IF sy-subrc = 0.
  ...
ENDIF.

"Read using the index
READ TABLE it INDEX 1 TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.

IF sy-subrc = 0.
  ...
ENDIF.

"Read using the key
IF line_exists( it[ b = 2 ] ).
  ...
ENDIF.

"Read using the index
IF line_exists( it[ 1 ] ).
  ...
ENDIF.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Checking the Index of a Line in an Internal Table

If you want to find out about the index of a line in an internal table, you can also make use of the `READ TABLE` statement above. If
the line is found, the system field `sy-tabix` is set to the number of the index. Otherwise, the built-in function
[`line_index( )`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenline_index_function.htm) can be used. It returns the index of the found line or 0 if the line does not exist.

``` abap
DATA(itab) = VALUE string_table( ( `aaa` ) ( `bbb` ) ).
READ TABLE itab WITH KEY table_line = `bbb` TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.
"2
DATA(tabix) = sy-tabix.

"1
DATA(idx) = line_index( itab[ table_line = `aaa` ] ).

"Note: No primary table index with hashed tables
DATA(hashed_tab) = VALUE string_hashed_table( ( `a` ) ( `b` ) ( `c` ) ).
"-1
DATA(hashed_primary_idx) = line_index( hashed_tab[ table_line = `c` ] ).

"Index access in hashed tables only using a secondary table index
TYPES: BEGIN OF s,
          comp1 TYPE i,
          comp2 TYPE i,
        END OF s,
        ttype TYPE HASHED TABLE OF s WITH UNIQUE KEY comp1 WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY sk COMPONENTS comp2.

DATA(hashed_tab2) = VALUE ttype( ( comp1 = 1 comp2 = 10 )
                                 ( comp1 = 2 comp2 = 8 )
                                 ( comp1 = 3 comp2 = 9 ) ).

"3
DATA(hashed_secondary_idx) = line_index( hashed_tab2[ KEY sk comp2 = 10 ] ).
"1
hashed_secondary_idx = line_index( hashed_tab2[ KEY sk comp2 = 8 ] ).
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top</a></p>

### Checking How Many Lines Exist in an Internal Table

`lines( )` is another built-in function that you can use to check how many lines exist in an internal table. It returns an integer value.

``` abap
DATA(itab) = VALUE string_table( ( `a` ) ( `b` ) ( `c` ) ( `d` ) ( `e` ) ).

"5
DATA(number_of_lines) = lines( itab ).

          comp2 TYPE i,

### Getting Table (Type) Information at Runtime

Using [Runtime Type Identification (RTTI)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrun_time_type_identific_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
you can get type information on internal tables and table types at runtime. 

For more information, see the [Dynamic Programming](06_Dynamic_Programming.md) ABAP cheat sheet.

RTTI example: 
```abap
TYPES tab_type TYPE SORTED TABLE OF zdemo_abap_flsch
       WITH UNIQUE KEY carrid connid
       WITH NON-UNIQUE SORTED KEY sec_key ALIAS sk COMPONENTS countryfr cityto.
DATA itab TYPE tab_type.

DATA(tdo_d) = cl_abap_typedescr=>describe_by_data( itab ).
"DATA(tdo_d) = cl_abap_typedescr=>describe_by_name( 'TAB_TYPE' ).

"Cast to get more specific information
DATA(tdo_itab) = CAST cl_abap_tabledescr( cl_abap_typedescr=>describe_by_data( itab ) ).
"DATA(tdo_itab) = CAST cl_abap_tabledescr( tdo_d ).

DATA(type_category_itab) = tdo_itab->kind.
DATA(relative_name_itab) = tdo_itab->get_relative_name( ).
... "Explore more options by positioning the cursor behind -> and choosing CTRL + Space
DATA(table_kind_itab) = tdo_itab->table_kind.
DATA(table_keys_itab) = tdo_itab->key.
DATA(table_keys_more_details_itab) = tdo_itab->get_keys( ).
DATA(table_has_unique_key_itab) = tdo_itab->has_unique_key.
DATA(table_key_alias_itab) = tdo_itab->get_key_aliases( ).
DATA(line_type_itab) = tdo_itab->get_table_line_type( ).
DATA(table_component_info_itab) = CAST cl_abap_structdescr( tdo_itab->get_table_line_type( ) ).

## Operations with Internal Tables Using ABAP SQL SELECT Statements

### Internal Tables as Target Data Objects in SELECT Queries

Adding multiple lines from a database table to an internal table using
[`SELECT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapselect.htm),
for example, based on a condition. In the case below, the internal table
is created inline. 
``` abap
SELECT FROM dbtab
  FIELDS comp1, comp2 ...
  WHERE ...
  INTO TABLE @DATA(itab_sel).
```

Adding multiple lines from a database table using `SELECT`, for example, based on a condition when the database table has a line type that is incompatible with the internal table. The `*` character means that all fields are selected. The other examples define specific fields.
The `APPENDING CORRESPONDING FIELDS INTO TABLE` addition appends the selected data to the end of the table without deleting existing
table entries. The `INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE` addition adds lines and deletes existing table entries.
``` abap
SELECT FROM dbtab2
  FIELDS *
  WHERE ...
  APPENDING CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE @itab.

SELECT FROM dbtab2
  FIELDS *
  WHERE ...
  INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE @itab.
```

Combining data from multiple database tables into one internal table using an [inner
join](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninner_join_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
The following example uses the [`INNER JOIN`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapselect_join.htm) addition. Note that the field list includes fields from both tables. The fields are referred to using `~`.
``` abap
SELECT db1~comp1, db1~comp2, db2~comp_abc, db2~comp_xyz ...
  FROM db1
  INNER JOIN db2 ON db1~comp1 = db2~comp1
  INTO TABLE @DATA(it_join_result).
```

Populating an internal table from a database table using
[subqueries](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensubquery_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
The following two examples populate an internal table from a database table. In the first example, a subquery is specified in the
`WHERE` clause with the `NOT IN` addition. It checks whether a value matches a value in a set of values
specified in parentheses. The second example populates an internal table depending on data in another table. A subquery with the `EXISTS` addition is specified in
the `WHERE` clause. In this
case, the result of the subquery, which is another
`SELECT` statement, is checked to see if an entry exists in
a table based on the specified conditions.

``` abap
SELECT comp1, comp2, ...
  FROM dbtab
  WHERE comp1 NOT IN ( a, b, c ... )
  INTO TABLE @DATA(it_subquery_result1).

SELECT comp1, comp2, ...
  FROM db1
  WHERE EXISTS¬†( SELECT 'X' FROM db2
                 WHERE comp1 = db1~comp1 )
  INTO TABLE @DATA(it_subquery_result2).
```

Populating an internal table from a table based on the existence of data in
another table using the [`FOR ALL ENTRIES`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenwhere_all_entries.htm) addition.

> [!NOTE] 
> Make sure that the internal table you are reading from is not initial. Therefore, it is recommended that you use a subquery as shown above: `... ( SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... ) ...`.

``` abap
IF itab IS NOT INITIAL.

  SELECT dbtab~comp1, dbtab~comp2, ...
    FROM dbtab
    FOR ALL ENTRIES IN @itab
    WHERE comp1 = @itab-comp1
    INTO TABLE @DATA(it_select_result).

ENDIF.
```

### SELECT Queries with Internal Tables as Data Sources

**General rule**: Use `SELECT` with internal tables as a data source only when SQL functionality, such as joins, exceeds ABAP statements.

**Technical considerations**:
- The [ABAP SQL in-memory engine](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_sql_inmemeng_glosry.htm) manages read access with ABAP SQL `SELECT` statements for tabular data within the memory of an [Application Server ABAP (AS ABAP)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenas_abap_glosry.htm). The tabular data can include:
  - Database table data (such as data from DDIC database tables or CDS entities) buffered in the [table buffer](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenas_abap_glosry.htm) within AS ABAP. Buffering ability is determined by specifications in the artifacts. If the data isn't buffered, the engine can't handle it, and the SQL statement is processed on the database.
  - Internal tables present in the current internal session. They are treated like DDIC database tables. ABAP types are mapped to corresponding [built-in DDIC types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenbuiltin_ddic_type_glosry.htm).
- The ABAP SQL in-memory engine processes data on AS ABAP, not the database server. If a `SELECT` statement using internal tables as data sources includes elements beyond the engine's capability (for example, most subqueries aren't supported; see detailed restrictions [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/ABENSQL_ENGINE_RESTR.html)), the internal table content is transferred to a temporary database table before the query executes. Only components involved in the read access are transferred.
- In such cases, the SQL statement runs directly on the database server, not within AS ABAP. If the compiler identifies a statement the ABAP SQL in-memory engine can't handle, a syntax warning occurs. You can suppress this warning using the pragma `##itab_db_select`.
- Currently, queries with multiple internal tables can only proceed if the ABAP SQL in-memory engine can manage them on AS ABAP directly. Transferring more than one internal table to the database is currently not supported.
- The result of the ABAP SQL in-memory engine processing is identical to processing the read access directly on the database.

**Using internal tables as data sources in ABAP SQL SELECT statements**:

- You must specify internal tables as [host variables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenhost_variable_glosry.htm) with an `@` prefix and give them an alias.
   ``` abap
   SELECT comp1, comp2, ...
      FROM @itab AS it_alias
      WHERE ...
      INTO TABLE @DATA(itab_sel).
   ```
- Internal tables are treated like DDIC database tables, which leads to specific behaviors such as:
  - They are handled like [client-independent](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenclient_independent_glosry.htm) database tables, and the first table column is not automatically considered a client column. You can change this default behavior using the `DECLARE CLIENT` addition. For example, if the internal table specifies a key that is not specified at the beginning of the line type, you cannot use `SELECT` to retrieve data from the table. 
  ```abap
  TYPES: BEGIN OF s,
          comp1 TYPE i,
          comp2 TYPE i,
          comp3 TYPE i,
         END OF s.
  DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF s WITH KEY comp3.
  "SELECT SINGLE * FROM @itab AS tab INTO @DATA(line).
  ```
  - You cannot use deep and nested components of internal tables in `SELECT` statements.
  - The type string is supported only if declared as a reference to the built-in dictionary type `sstring`.
- A key advantage of using `SELECT` statements with internal tables as data sources is the access to ABAP SQL's extensive functionalities, like aggregate expressions.
- They can serve as an alternative to the `READ TABLE` or `LOOP AT` statements if the ABAP SQL in-memory engine can process the data without requiring a database transfer.
- Note the general rule: You should use `SELECT` with internal tables as a data source only when SQL functionality exceeds that of ABAP statements, such as in joins. For tasks achievable with ABAP statements, it is preferable to use them as they are optimized for internal tables and offer better performance.

#### Restrictions Regarding Internal Tables as Data Sources in ABAP SQL SELECT Statements

- This excursion is intended to underscore the restrictions mentioned above and in the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensql_engine_restr.htm) in more detail when selecting from internal tables. 
- Components having deep types cannot be included, for example, in the `SELECT` list or `WHERE` clause. 
- Among the non-allowed types of internal table components are strings (as they are deep types) and `utclong`.
- Note that only those fields are checked (and sent to the database) that are actually used (as shown in the example below). 
- However, the type string is allowed if it is declared using the built-in dictionary type `sstring` (for example, a component typed with a [data element](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_element_glosry.htm) or a [CDS simple type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_simple_type_glosry.htm) that uses `sstring`).

The following example demonstrates various `SELECT` statements. A demo internal table has a component that is typed with a CDS simple type, which can be created as follows:
- In ADT, right-click your pacakage, and choose *New -> Other Repository Object* 
- Insert *type* and select *Type* under *Core Data Services*.
- Choose *Next* and provide a name (e.g. `zdemo_abap_string`) and a description.
- Choose *Finish*.
- Find more information on CDS simple types [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencds_simple_types.htm).

The code of the CDS simple type may look as follows: 

```abap
@EndUserText.label: 'String type'
define type zdemo_abap_string: abap.sstring( 1333 );
```

Commented code example:

```abap
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*& Internal table having a component of type string
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*

"Creating and populating an internal table that includes a component that is
"typed with type string

         comp2 TYPE c LENGTH 3,
         comp3 TYPE string,
       END OF s1,
       tab_type_1 TYPE TABLE OF s1 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(itab1) = VALUE tab_type_1( ( comp1 = 1 comp2 = 'aaa' comp3 = `ABAP` ) ).

"Columns of type string cannot be used in SELECT statements that
"select from internal tables (* selects all fields). Therefore, the
"following statements are commented out.

"SELECT SINGLE * FROM @itab1 AS it WHERE comp1 = 1 INTO @DATA(res1).
"SELECT SINGLE comp1 FROM @itab1 AS it where comp3 = `ABAP` INTO @DATA(res2).
"SELECT SINGLE comp3 FROM @itab1 AS it where comp1 = 1 INTO @DATA(res3).

"However, the following statements work. No component of type string is involved.
SELECT SINGLE comp1 FROM @itab1 AS it WHERE comp2 = 'aaa' INTO @DATA(res4).

       tab_type_2 TYPE TABLE OF s2 WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(itab2) = VALUE tab_type_2( ( comp1 = 1 comp2 = 'aaa' comp3 = `ABAP` ) ).

"Unlike above, the following SELECT statements are possible

SELECT SINGLE comp1 FROM @itab2 AS it WHERE comp3 = `ABAP` INTO @DATA(res7).
SELECT SINGLE comp1, comp3 FROM @itab2 AS it WHERE comp2 = 'aaa' AND comp3 = `ABAP` INTO @DATA(res8).
"Note: `ABAP` represents a literal of type string. When specifying it here
"like it is specified above, there is an implicit conversion. The following
"example uses a typed literal.

#### Excursion: Joining/Merging Internal Tables into Internal Tables

The following code snippets demonstrate joining/merging the content of two simple internal tables into another table. There may be several ways to achieve this. Here, the intention is to give an idea and, in particular, to emphasize SQL functionalities also available for internal tables (note the restrictions mentioned above and in the documentation).

Assumptions:
- The target table is either created inline or exists and includes components from the source tables or components that can be mapped.
- One or more components are common between the source tables to perform a join or merge the table content.

The code snippet shows a selection of syntax options and includes the following statements:
- Joins with `SELECT` (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, CTE)

### Improving Read Performance with Secondary Table Keys

- Consider a scenario where you have a standard internal table that you access frequently using the primary table key or a free key. The table is declared without a secondary key. 
- In both cases, the read performance is slow because these accesses are not optimized in standard tables.
- You can add a secondary key to optimize access and improve read performance.
- The following example creates three demo internal tables: two without a secondary key, accessed by the primary key and a free key, and a third table declared with a secondary key. All tables are populated with many table lines. Then, in a `DO` loop, multiple reads are performed on the internal tables. Before and after the reads, the current timestamp is retrieved to evaluate runtime. Find additional details in the similarly structured example in the next section. The results should demonstrate a significant performance improvement for reads on an internal table using the secondary key.
- To try the example out, create a demo class named `zcl_demo_abap` and insert the provided code. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. The example is set up to display the results in the console.

> [!NOTE] 
> This example is for [exploration, experimentation, and demonstration](./README.md#%EF%B8%8F-disclaimer). It is not intended for accurate runtime or performance testing and is not a suitable method for such purposes. Due to its simplified nature, results may vary and not be entirely accurate, even across multiple runs.

### Example: Exploring Read Access Performance with Internal Tables

- The following example explores the performance of read accesses to internal tables of various kinds in a simplified and self-contained manner. 
- The scenario is: Lines of a large internal table (2000 table lines) are read frequently. 
- The read accesses are executed using `READ TABLE` statements, which access the tables by: 
  - Index (both primary and secondary table index) 
  - Key (primary table key, secondary table key, free key)
- To try the example out, create a demo class named `zcl_demo_abap` and insert the provided code. After activation, choose *F9* in ADT to execute the class. It may take some time to finish and display the output. The example is set up to display the results in the console.

> [!NOTE] 
> - This example is for [exploration, experimentation, and demonstration](./README.md#%EF%B8%8F-disclaimer) purposes only. It is not suitable for accurate runtime or performance testing. Due to its simplified nature (for example, the table line type is fairly simple, and the key components are all of type `i`) and various factors that can influence the runtime of an ABAP program, results may vary and may not be entirely accurate, even across multiple runs. The displayed results may not always accurately reflect the performance notes from the cheat sheet.
> - The example concentrates on a few demo internal tables, declared using various declaration options. 
> - The runtime analysis in this self-contained example is as follows: The code snippet for which the runtime should be measured is enclosed by two timestamp retrievals using `utclong_current( )`. The runtime is analysed by calculating the delta of the two timestamp values, indicating the used runtime for the code snippet. To have a more meaningful example regarding the runtime analysis, the snippets are executed multiple times, indicated by enclosing them in a `DO` loop. The runtime delta value is added to an internal table collecting all runtime delta values for the specific code snippet for all loop iterations. Finally, the average runtime is calculated based on the collected runtime delta values. This average runtime value is added to an internal with other information. The approach with multiple iterations and the average runtime value aims to provide a balanced view of runtime. Note that this implementation is for exploration and demonstration purposes only.
> - Among the demonstrated read operations are the following:
>   - Index accesses (standard and sorted tables, hashed tables using the secondary table index)
>   - Primary table key accesses (various tables specified with a single and multiple key components; examples with full key, partial and left-aligned key, partial and not left-aligned key)
>   - Secondary table key access
>   - Free key access
>   - Dynamic key specifications
> - The following points should be reflected by the result: 
>   - Index access is generally very fast.
>   - (Full) primary table key access in hashed tables is fast.
>   - Standard tables with specified secondary keys offer optimized access.
>   - Both full and partial, left-aligned key accesses in sorted tables are optimized.
>   - Free key searches are generally slower (unless used with the BINARY SEARCH addition in standard tables).
>   - Key access in standard tables is relatively slow, except for secondary table keys.
>   - Dynamic key specifications require effort for evaluation.
> - The purpose of this example is to underscore the significance of choosing the right table categories for your internal tables, tailored to your specific use case and the frequency of table access.

Notes on ...

... primary table key and primary table index: 
- Each internal table has a primary key, which can be custom-defined or use the standard key. In standard tables, it is also possible to use an empty key. 
  - Be aware of the implications of specifying the standard key, either intentionally or unintentionally. The standard key combines all character-like components, such as `txt` in the example below, while the remaining components are of type `i`.
  - The primary key of a table is ... 
    - a hash key in hashed tables, 
    - a sorted key in sorted tables, 
    - always non-unique in standard tables. 
- Key access is optimized for hashed and sorted tables, but not for standard tables. 
  - You cannot modify key fields in hashed and sorted tables. 
  - In standard tables, key access is not optimized regarding the primary table index (for the secondary table index, it is optimized) because the search is linear. 
  - In sorted tables, optimized access is also possible for partial primary table key specifications. As a prerequisite, the key specification must be left-aligned and gap-free. For example, if the primary table key consists of components `a`, `b`, and `c`, optimized access is valid if only `a` and `b` are specified. If the keys are not left-aligned, such as in the case where `b` and `c` are specified without `a`, optimized access is not applicable, and a linear search will be used.
- Generally, the larger the table, the slower the key access. The benefit of hash tables is that they offer constant access time, even for very large tables.
- Sorted and standard tables have a primary table index, hence their designation as index tables. 
- The primary table index assigns a unique line number to each table line. 
  - The index updates whenever a line is added or removed. 
  - Unlike key access, access time via the index does not increase linearly with table size.

... secondary table key and secondary table index:
- Secondary table keys, which can be sorted or hashed, are available for all table categories. 
- They enhance table access efficiency and performance. 
- Declaring a secondary table key generates a corresponding secondary table index. However, the index for a non-unique key does not update immediately upon adding or deleting a line (for unique keys, it does). The update happens when the internal table is accessed using the secondary table key. 
- In ABAP statements, you must specify the secondary table key explicitly. Otherwise, the primary table key is used implicitly. 
- Data access using the secondary table key is always optimized, even for standard tables. Thus, even older standard tables can gain from optimized access by adding secondary table keys later, without impacting existing table-related statements. 
- However, weigh the administrative costs of secondary table keys. Use them only in scenarios where they offer substantial benefits, like large internal tables that are filled once and rarely altered. Frequent modifications can lead to regular index updates, potentially impacting performance.

... the use of table categories:
- Standard tables: 
  - Suitable for ... 
    - small, sequentially accessed tables that are often accessed by index 
    - tables where sorting is not critical. However, you can explicitly sort using `SORT` statements, especially after table population.
    - tables that are populated frequently, as there is no need to check for unique entries regarding the primary table key. 
  - Access speed: 
    - Fast: By index, optimized key access with secondary table keys, and free keys using `READ TABLE ... BINARY SEARCH` statements (Note: It is recommended to use secondary table keys for an optimized access.)
    - Slow: Primary table and free key

- Sorted tables: 
  - Suitable for ...
    - large tables requiring consistent sorted content 
    - tables frequently accessed both by index and in sequence 
  - Access is fast by index, primary table key (always optimized; also optimized for an incomplete, left-aligned and gap-free primary table key specification), secondary table key (also optimized)

- Hashed tables: 
  - Suitable for ...
    - very large tables that are filled once and rarely altered 
    - tables where key-based access is the primary method 
    - tables that do not require index access on the primary table index 
  - Access is ... 
    - fast and optimized for both primary and secondary table keys 
    - consistent for large internal tables due to a special hash algorithm

### Generic Table Types with Formal Parameters of Methods and Field Symbols


- [Formal parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenformal_parameter_glosry.htm) of methods or [field symbols](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfield_symbol_glosry.htm) can be specified with generic types.
- At runtime, the actual data type is copied from the assigned [actual parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenactual_parameter_glosry.htm) or memory area, i.e. they receive the complete data type only when an actual parameter is passed or a memory area is assigned.
- Among them, there are generic table types. For more information, refer to the [Data Types and Objects](16_Data_Types_and_Objects.md) cheat sheet and the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenbuilt_in_types_generic.htm).
- The following example mainly demonstrates formal parameters of methods that are typed with generic table types. The method calls and the tables passed are only possible if the generic types fit. For example, you cannot pass a hashed table to a method whose importing parameter is typed with the generic type `INDEX TABLE`. Invalid method calls and table passing are commented out.

### Searching and Replacing Substrings in Internal Tables with Character-Like Data Types

You can use [`FIND ... IN TABLE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapfind_itab.htm) statements to search for substrings in internal tables (standard tables without secondary table keys; with character-like line type) line by line. 

``` abap
DATA(str_table) = VALUE string_table( ( `aZbzZ` ) ( `cdZze` ) ( `Zzzf` ) ( `ghz` ) ).

"Finding all occurrences in a table
"Note: res_tab is of type match_result_tab 
"You can also restrict the search range in an internal table; see an example in REPLACE ... IN TABLE

  RESULTS DATA(res_tab)
  RESPECTING CASE.

"1. line: 1, offset: 1, length: 1, submatches: (initial)
"2. line: 1, offset: 4, length: 1, ...
"3. line: 2, offset: 2, length: 1, ...
"4. line: 3, offset: 0, length: 1, ...

"Finding the first occurrence in a table
"Note: res_struc, which is declared inline here, is of type match_result

Replacements in internal tables with [`REPLACE ... IN TABLE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapreplace_itab.htm):

``` abap

### Ranges Tables

- Internal tables that have the predefined columns `SIGN`, `OPTION`, `LOW`, and `HIGH` 
  - `SIGN`: type c with length 1; indicates whether each line is included (`I`) or excluded (`E`) from the result set.
  - `OPTION`: type c with length 2; specifies the selection option for the condition. It uses comparison operators such as `EQ`, `NE`, `GE`, `GT`, `LE`, `LT`, `CP`, `NP`, `BT`, `NB`. Special rules apply for certain operators such as when using `CP` or `NP`, the `LOW` and `HIGH` columns must be character values.
  - `LOW`: The lower comparison value.
  - `HIGH`: The higher comparison value.
- Declared with the `TYPE RANGE OF` addition in `DATA` and `TYPES` statements 
- Used to store range conditions that can be evaluated in expressions using the `IN` operator (each row in the table represents a separate comparison)

```abap
"Populating an integer table with values from 1 to 20
TYPES int_tab_type TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(inttab) = VALUE int_tab_type( FOR x = 1 WHILE x <= 20 ( x ) ).

"Declaring a ranges table
DATA rangestab TYPE RANGE OF i.

"Populating a ranges table using VALUE

                                   ( low = 12 high = 15 )
                     option = 'GE' ( low = 18 ) ).

"Using a SELECT statement and the IN addition to retrieve internal table
"content based on the ranges table specifications
SELECT * FROM @inttab AS tab
    WHERE table_line IN @rangestab
    INTO TABLE @DATA(result).

In the context of [ABAP RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenarap_glosry.htm), the operands of [ABAP EML](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_eml_glosry.htm) statements and parameters of [RAP handler methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabp_handler_method_glosry.htm) and [RAP saver methods](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabp_saver_method_glosry.htm) are mainly special messenger tables for passing data and receiving results or messages: [BDEF derived types](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrap_derived_type_glosry.htm) - special ABAP types (internal tables and structures) that are tailor-made for RAP purposes.

```abap
"Example declarations
"For an EML create operation
DATA create_tab TYPE TABLE FOR CREATE entity.

"For an update operation
DATA update_tab TYPE TABLE FOR UPDATE entity.

"Type declaration using a BDEF derived type
TYPES der_typ TYPE TABLE FOR DELETE entity.
```

### Creating Internal Tables Dynamically

Find more information in the [Dynamic Programming cheat sheet](06_Dynamic_Programming.md).

```abap
DATA(some_type) = 'STRING'.
DATA dataref TYPE REF TO data.

"Creating an internal table using a CREATE DATA statement
"by specifying the type name dynamically.
"In the example, a standard table with elementary line type
"and standard key is created.
CREATE DATA dataref TYPE TABLE OF (some_type).

TYPES: BEGIN OF demo_struc,
          comp1 TYPE c LENGTH 10,
          comp2 TYPE i,
          comp3 TYPE i,
        END OF demo_struc.

"Internal table with structured line type and empty key.
CREATE DATA dataref TYPE TABLE OF ('DEMO_STRUC') WITH EMPTY KEY.

"Using a globally available table type
CREATE DATA dataref TYPE ('STRING_TABLE').
