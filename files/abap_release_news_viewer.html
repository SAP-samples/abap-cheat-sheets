Before, the documentation was configured implicitly from system settings. The configuration of the ABAP Keyword Documentation is saved in customizing table ABDOCCONFIG, that is maintained with transaction code ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG (based on executable program ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG) or with the configuration entity ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG_ENTITY. All repository objects related to the configuration are documented. The following properties can be set: CP If set to X, the ABAP Keyword Documentation uses terms appropriate for the SAP BTP ABAP environment (aka Steampunk) instead of Application Server ABAP in some footers and copyright texts. Recommendation: Set to X in systems of the SAP BTP ABAP environment. Set to initial in all other systems. ICF Enables or disables the Web Version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation based on ICF nodes /sap/public/bc/abap/docu and /sap/bc/abap/docu. The following settings can be applied: If set to X, the Web Version is enabled. The execution of example programs from the Web Version is disabled. If set to E, the Web Version is enabled. The execution of example programs from the Web Version is also enabled. Recommendation: Set to E in SAP development systems. Set to E in customer development systems. Set to X in SAP S/4HANA. Set to initial in SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud. BATCH If set to X, the infrastructure of the ABAP Keyword Documentation is allowed to start batch jobs that prepare buffers that are needed for search in and display of the documentation. Recommendation: Set to X in SAP S/4HANA. Set to initial in SAP BTP ABAP environment. MAILBOX If set to X, the ABAP Keyword Documentation display offers a function to send a feedback mail to abap.docu@exchange.sap.corp. This mailbox is only available to SAP employees. Therefore, the setting makes sense for SAP's own development systems only. Recommendation: Set to X in SAP's own development systems. Set to initial in all other systems. VERSION Determines the ABAP language version for which the ABAP Keyword Documentation is displayed. Allowed values are defined in domain ABAPVRS. This setting can be overridden when calling the documentation using the respective APIs: CL_ABAP_DOCU for the SAP GUI version CL_ABAP_DOCU_EXTERNAL for the ADT or Web version. Calls to the documentation from ABAP Workbench and ADT set the language version depending on the object currently being edited. Calls to the documentation via the ABAPDOCU and ABAPHELP transactions use the version from ABDOCCONFIG by default. An initial value for VERSION in ABDOCCONFIG displays the documentation for Standard ABAP (X). Recommendation: Set to X in SAP S/4HANA Set to 5 in SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Program ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG allows a choice to be made between different sets of parameters: Parameter set typical for SAP development systems Parameter set typical for customer development systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP environment Parameter set typical for SAP BTP ABAP environment Current parameter set The passed parameters are used as default values for a dialog window and can be overridden there. If customizing table ABDOCCONFIG is initial in a customer system, the first call of the ABAP Keyword documentation supplies it with values recommended for an SAP S/4HANA System. In SAP's own systems, values for a SAP development system are supplied. If the table is partly filled, default values are used for the missing rows.

Alignment gaps arise from the alignment requirements of the component's data types. For character-like components, the alignment requirement depends on the character representation: For character representation UCS-2 used by the ABAP programming language, the memory address of character-like data objects must be divisible by 2. For other character representations there are other alignment requirements. For example, the non-Unicode character representation ASCII has no alignment requirement while the Unicode character representation UTF-32 requires a divisibility by 4. Meanwhile, only Unicode systems are supported. The system code page is UTF-16 and its subset UCS-2 is supported in the ABAP language. Any character is represented by 2 bytes and the alignment requirement is always a divisibility by 2. Because of this, the conversion rules for flat structures can be less strict than before and the new determination of possible alignment gaps was introduced in ABAP release 7.73. Example For example, the following assignment between two flat structures was not possible before ABAP release 7.73 but is possible now. TYPES:   BEGIN OF incl1,     num TYPE i,     c2  TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF incl1. DATA:   BEGIN OF struc1,     c1 TYPE c LENGTH 2.     INCLUDE TYPE incl1.

In the included substructure incl1, the character component has the same alignment as the integer component and there is no alignment gap. As long as non-Unicode Systems were supported, however, an alignment gap had to be assumed behind the included structure in order to make the program executable in Unicode systems as well as in non-Unicode Systems.

Before, the documentation was configured implicitly from system settings. The configuration of the ABAP Keyword Documentation is saved in customizing table ABDOCCONFIG, that is maintained with transaction code ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG (based on executable program ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG) or with the configuration entity ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG_ENTITY. All repository objects related to the configuration are documented. The following properties can be set: CP If set to X, the ABAP Keyword Documentation uses terms appropriate for the SAP BTP ABAP environment (aka Steampunk) instead of Application Server ABAP in some footers and copyright texts. Recommendation: Set to X in systems of the SAP BTP ABAP environment. Set to initial in all other systems. ICF Enables or disables the Web Version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation based on ICF nodes /sap/public/bc/abap/docu and /sap/bc/abap/docu. The following settings can be applied: If set to X, the Web Version is enabled. The execution of example programs from the Web Version is disabled. If set to E, the Web Version is enabled. The execution of example programs from the Web Version is also enabled. Recommendation: Set to E in SAP development systems. Set to E in customer development systems. Set to X in SAP S/4HANA. Set to initial in SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud. BATCH If set to X, the infrastructure of the ABAP Keyword Documentation is allowed to start batch jobs that prepare buffers that are needed for search in and display of the documentation. Recommendation: Set to X in SAP S/4HANA. Set to initial in SAP BTP ABAP environment. MAILBOX If set to X, the ABAP Keyword Documentation display offers a function to send a feedback mail to abap.docu@exchange.sap.corp. This mailbox is only available to SAP employees. Therefore, the setting makes sense for SAP's own development systems only. Recommendation: Set to X in SAP's own development systems. Set to initial in all other systems. VERSION Determines the ABAP language version for which the ABAP Keyword Documentation is displayed. Allowed values are defined in domain ABAPVRS. This setting can be overridden when calling the documentation using the respective APIs: CL_ABAP_DOCU for the SAP GUI version CL_ABAP_DOCU_EXTERNAL for the ADT or Web version. Calls to the documentation from ABAP Workbench and ADT set the language version depending on the object currently being edited. Calls to the documentation via the ABAPDOCU and ABAPHELP transactions use the version from ABDOCCONFIG by default. An initial value for VERSION in ABDOCCONFIG displays the documentation for Standard ABAP (X). Recommendation: Set to X in SAP S/4HANA Set to 5 in SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Program ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG allows a choice to be made between different sets of parameters: Parameter set typical for SAP development systems Parameter set typical for customer development systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP environment Parameter set typical for SAP BTP ABAP environment Current parameter set The passed parameters are used as default values for a dialog window and can be overridden there. If customizing table ABDOCCONFIG is initial in a customer system, the first call of the ABAP Keyword documentation supplies it with values recommended for an SAP S/4HANA System. In SAP's own systems, values for a SAP development system are supplied. If the table is partly filled, default values are used for the missing rows.

Alignment gaps arise from the alignment requirements of the component's data types. For character-like components, the alignment requirement depends on the character representation: For character representation UCS-2 used by the ABAP programming language, the memory address of character-like data objects must be divisible by 2. For other character representations there are other alignment requirements. For example, the non-Unicode character representation ASCII has no alignment requirement while the Unicode character representation UTF-32 requires a divisibility by 4. Before only Unicode systems were supported, the conversion rules for structures had to take all possible alignment requirements for characters into account, regardless of the actual length of a character in its character representation. Meanwhile, only Unicode systems are supported. The system codepage is UTF-16 and its subset UCS-2 is supported in ABAP language. Any character is represented by 2 bytes and the alignment requirement is always a divisibility by 2. Because of this, the conversion rules for flat structures can be less strict than before and the new determination of possible alignment gaps was introduced in ABAP release 7.53. Example For example, the following assignment between two flat structures was not possible before ABAP release 7.53 but is possible now. TYPES:   BEGIN OF incl1,     num TYPE i,     c2  TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF incl1. DATA:   BEGIN OF struc1,     c1 TYPE c LENGTH 2.     INCLUDE TYPE incl1.

In the included substructure incl1, the character component has the same alignment as the integer component and there is no alignment gap. But as long as non-Unicode Systems were supported, an alignment gap had to be assumed behind the included structure in order to make the program executable in Unicode systems as well as in non-Unicode Systems.

General corrections From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, the content of the operand n of the additions UP TO n ROWS and PACKAGE SIZE of the statement SELECT meet the rules of a lossless assignment for the data type i. Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02, the operator IN range_tab of a WHERE condition was not always checked statically to see whether the columns LOW and HIGH of the ranges table range_tab could be converted to the data type of the database and non-convertible columns did not produce a runtime error in cases where the ranges table was empty. Now, a static check is always made a non-convertible columns always raise an exception. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: DATA: range_tab TYPE RANGE OF t,       itab TYPE TABLE OF sflight. SELECT *        FROM sflight        INTO TABLE itab        WHERE fldate IN range_tab. Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02, multiple NOT operators could be placed consecutively in a WHERE condition. An even or odd number of consecutive NOT operators is the same as no NOT or a single NOT, which means that surplus NOT operators can now no longer be specified. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT SINGLE *        FROM spfli        INTO wa WHERE        NOT NOT carrid = 'LH'. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it was possible to read the client column when using alias names defined with AS or joins in ON and WHERE conditions, without disabling implicit client handling using CLIENT SPECIFIED. In this case, the result set is empty whenever the explicitly specified client is not the current client. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this situation produces a syntax check warning. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax warnings for: SELECT *        FROM scarr AS carriers        INTO TABLE itab        WHERE carriers~mandt = '...'. and SELECT *        FROM scarr        INNER JOIN spfli        on scarr~mandt = spfli~mandt        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE itab        WHERE scarr~mandt = '...'. The addition GROUP BY cannot be specified for pooled tables and cluster tables. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it was possible to specify a column dynamically after GROUP BY; however this always raised an exception. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a dynamically specified GROUP BY clause in pooled tables and cluster tables produces a syntax warning; this warning will become a syntax error in a future SP. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning or error for: SELECT id object langu typ        FROM doktl        INTO TABLE itab        GROUP BY (`ID OBJECT LANGU TYP`). Corrections for Dynamic Tokens Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a single period (.) could be specified in the dynamic tokens of any ABAP SQL statements. This period was ignored when the token was evaluated at runtime. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a period like this raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT *        FROM (`SPFLI .`)        INTO TABLE itab        WHERE (`. CARRID = 'LH'`). Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02, an alias name could be given more than once in cases where columns were specified dynamically in the SELECT list of the columns after SELECT using column_syntax, even though this is not allowed statically. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SEMANTICS. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT SINGLE ('carrid AS col carrname AS col')        FROM scarr        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF wa        WHERE carrid = 'LH'. Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02 the statically compulsory addition DISTINCT could be omitted when the aggregate function COUNT( DISTINCT col ) was specified dynamically and all rows of the result set were counted. From ABAP release7.40 SP02, the omission of DISTINCT raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT ('COUNT( carrid )')        FROM spfli        INTO count. ENDSELECT. In previous releases (before 7.40 SP02), a NOT could be mistakenly written directly in front of a comparison operator in a dynamic WHERE condition (which is not possible in the static case). With ABAP release 7.40 SP02 and higher, this raises an exception of class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT SINGLE *        FROM spfli        INTO wa        WHERE (`carrid NOT = 'LH'`). Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02 it was possible to use (incorrectly) a dynamic FROM clause combined with the addition ORDER BY PRIMARY KEY to access DDIC projection views containing the same number of key fields and view fields, which is not possible in static cases. From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, this raises the exception CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, an exception is raised when projection_view has the same number of key fields and view fields. DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF projection_view. SELECT *        FROM ('KELLERH_VIEW')        INTO TABLE itab        ORDER BY PRIMARY KEY. SAP-internal hint For DDIC database views the exception is raised only in the strict modes from 7.40, SP05 on. Corrections for the aggregate function count( * ) As in all aggregate functions, the target field must be chosen appropriately in the case of count( * ) or count(*) and no values must be lost when the result is assigned. This was not checked before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, and assignments were made in accordance with the conversions rules. This did not always raise an exception when values were lost. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the target field must be numeric and a loss of values always produces an exception. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning and exception (if the value does not fit in the target field) for: DATA cnt TYPE c LENGTH 1. SELECT COUNT(*)        FROM scarr        INTO cnt. When individual columns or aggregate expressions are specified in the SELECT list, an explicit work area must usually be specified and the obsolete short form is not possible. The only exception here is when count( * ) is used to specify nothing, if no alias name and no GROUP BY clause was specified. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the short form using count( * ), specified together with an alias name or a GROUP BY clause, produced a runtime error. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: TABLES scarr. SELECT COUNT( * ) AS cnt        FROM scarr. SELECT count( * )        FROM scarr        GROUP BY carrid.    ... ENDSELECT. Corrections when using the built-in types LCHR and LRAW from ABAP Dictionary. Columns of the types LCHR and LRAW cannot be used in relational expressions of the SQL conditions. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this produced a runtime error. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT SINGLE *        FROM  indx        INTO wa        WHERE clustd = '...'. Columns of the types LCHR and LRAW cannot be read using SELECT if the addition DISTINCT is specified. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this produced a runtime error. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT DISTINCT *        FROM  indx        INTO TABLE itab. Columns of the types LCHR and LRAW can be read using SELECT only if they are read together with the associated length fields. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, columns of this type read without length fields produced a syntax warning. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this situation always produces a runtime error. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, runtime errors for: SELECT clustd        FROM  indx        INTO TABLE itab. Corrections for FOR ALL ENTRIES If FOR ALL ENTRIES is used in front of a WHERE condition of a SELECT statement, a column of the internal table must be specified in at least one comparison (the comparison can also be specified in a subquery). Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the subquery was not checked. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the comparison must be specified (statically or dynamically) even if a subquery is specified. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT carrid connid fldate        FROM sflight        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE rtab        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN itab        WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM sflight ). When FOR ALL ENTRIES is used in front of a WHERE condition of a SELECT statement, no database fields of the built-in types STRING and RAWSTRING plus LCHR and LRAW can occur in the SELECT list, since the implicit addition DISTINCT cannot be passed to the database system in this case. From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, a syntax warning occurs in the extended program check. This warning can be hidden by a pragma. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, pragma required for: SELECT *       FROM snwd_bpa       INTO TABLE bupas       FOR ALL ENTRIES IN orders       WHERE node_key = orders-buyer_guid       \#\#select_fae_with_lob[web_address]. If FOR ALL ENTRIES is used in front of a WHERE condition of a SELECT statement, no LOB handles can be created in the target area, since this produces an undefined result. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this was not identified correctly for locators, either statically or at runtime. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this produces a syntax error or raises an exception. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT picture        FROM demo_blob_table        INTO wa-picture        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN name_tab        WHERE name = name_tab-table_line. ENDSELECT. The addition FOR ALL ENTRIES should not be used with the addition GROUP BY. The addition GROUP BY is ignored if used together with FOR ALL ENTRIES. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this situation produces a syntax check warning. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax warning for: SELECT COUNT( * )        FROM spfli        INTO cnt        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN carriers        WHERE carrid = carriers-table_line        GROUP BY carrid. Corrections for ORDER BY Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it was possible to specify any text between a dynamically specified column after ORDER BY and the closing period of a SELECT statement and this text was ignored when the statement was executed. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this text produced a syntax warning; from ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it produces a syntax error. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax warning for: SELECT *        FROM scarr        INTO TABLE itab        ORDER BY (`CARRID`) carrname and so on. If the addition ORDER BY is specified together with FOR ALL ENTRIES, all columns of the primary key must be read; if not, the result is undefined. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning is produced in this case if known statically; at runtime, an exception is always raised. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning or exception for: SELECT carrid connid        FROM sflight        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE rtab        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN itab        WHERE carrid = itab-carrid AND              connid = itab-connid        ORDER BY PRIMARY KEY. If aggregate functions are specified after SELECT, all columns that are specified after ORDER BY and that do not have an alias name for an aggregation function must also be specified after SELECT and after GROUP BY. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the checks on this situation at runtime were not strict enough and the behavior was platform-dependent. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a violation of this rule always raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SEMANTICS. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, an exception from the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SEMANTICS for: SELECT COUNT( * )        FROM spfli        INTO (cnt)        GROUP BY ('CARRID')        ORDER BY ('CARRID').   ... ENDSELECT. An alias name in the SELECT list cannot be the name of a column to which no alias name is assigned. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the use of a name of this type after ORDER BY raised an exception. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT carrid connid AS carrid        FROM spfli        INTO TABLE itab        ORDER BY carrid. ", is_cloud: "" },

This enables a simple check to be made on the initial value, in particular for columns typed as reference variables. A static WHERE condition cannot contain any duplicate or overlapping specified keys, if the prerequisites for optimizations are met. This means that this change is occasionally incompatible: Syntax errors are now produced in those WHERE conditions in which a key column is checked using both a comparison for equality with one value and using IS INITIAL. Syntax warnings are no longer produced by mistake for non-optimizable type combinations in comparisons, even if the comparison does not contain any key columns. Non-optimizable type combinations now produce syntax warnings only if they actually modify key fields of a hash key or of the initial part of a sorted key. The syntax warnings have been improved so that the non-optimizable combination is mentioned in the text. The following type combinations were not previously detected as non-optimizable when secondary keys were used in comparisons: string with n, i (b, s), f, decfloat16, and decfloat34 xstring with c and string There was no syntax error or exception in these cases. Instead, all lines of the internal table were checked linearly when the statement was executed or reads performed using the primary key. Optimized reads are guaranteed when using secondary keys, which is why the combinations above now produce syntax errors or raise exceptions. This represents an incompatible change.

Any search key could be entered when accessing internal tables, but this was not very efficient. Also, standard tables were always searched linearly during key access. To be able to efficiently access an internal table with different keys, and to also allow efficient key access to standard tables, secondary table keys were introduced. From ABAP release 7.0, EhP2, secondary table keys can be defined for internal tables with TYPES and DATA as well as in ABAP Dictionary. An internal table can have up to 15 secondary table keys with different names. At the same time, what was previously the table key became the primary table key, and a predefined name for it, primary_key, was introduced. This can be replaced with an alias name in the enhanced definition of the primary table key in ABAP release 7.0, EhP2. Secondary table keys can be hash keys or sorted keys. A secondary table index is created for each sorted secondary key of an internal table. The previous table index, which exists only for index tables, becomes the primary table index.

If an update infringes the uniqueness of a secondary key, an exception is raised immediately. For block operations, such as statements between internal tables, or when internal tables are filled using SELECT, the behavior is the same as with inserting operations. When individual lines are modified using field symbols or data references that point to table lines, the secondary key administration of unique keys is updated upon the next access to the internal table (delayed update), and the secondary key administration of non-unique keys is updated upon the next explicit use of the secondary table key (lazy update).

Depending on the setting, the system then displays either the HTTP or standard breakpoints in the Editor. If, under Settings, the function Check Sorting Before READ BINARY SEARCH is selected, the system checks, before every execution of this statement, whether the internal table is sorted. If the table is not sorted, a runtime error occurs. This setting should only be activated shortly before reaching a relevant point in the source code, because there can be a significant loss in performance, depending on the table size. If the Check Sorting Before PROVIDE function was selected under settings, the system checks all of the relevant tables - and not just the area specified with extlim1 and extlim2 - for sorting and overlapping intervals when the long form of the PROVIDE statement is executed. When displaying exception objects, the system only displayed the key itself in the field display for the TEXTID attribute that contains the OTR key of the text description assigned to the exception. Because this key is generated automatically and is nothing more than a sequence of numbers, assigning the corresponding text to the exception was difficult. The reason for this is that the displayed value had to be compared with the values of all constants generated for the exception. To simplify the assignment, the name of the constant generated for the key is now displayed as a tooltip.
