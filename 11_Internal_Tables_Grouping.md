## Introduction

Similar to SQL's [`GROUP BY`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapgroupby_clause.htm),
there is also a [`GROUP BY`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by.htm)
for working with internal tables that can be used behind [`LOOP AT itab`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_variants.htm)
or in the form [`IN GROUP`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfor_in_group.htm)
in a table iteration with
[`FOR`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfor_itab.htm).
It replaces the clumsy group level processing with statements [`AT NEW ...`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapat_itab.htm)
that relies on the order of table columns and content that is sorted
respectively.

Thi cheat sheet explains the grouping of internal tables step by step
using a very simple case of an internal table `spfli_tab` that
is filled with data from the database table `SPFLI`. The
following steps show how the content of the internal table can be
grouped using [`LOOP AT GROUP BY`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by.htm).

## Grouping by One Column

The simplest form of grouping is by one column without explicitly
specifying the output behavior of the group loop:

``` abap
LOOP AT spfli_tab INTO wa
                  GROUP BY wa-carrid.
       ... wa-carrid ...
ENDLOOP.
```

Within the loop, there is access to the work area `wa`, in
particular to the component `wa-carrid` that is used for
grouping. The work area `wa` contains the first line of each
group and represents the group in the loop. This is called
representative binding.

To access the members of a group, a member loop can be inserted into the
group loop:
``` abap
LOOP AT spfli_tab INTO wa 
                  GROUP BY wa-carrid.
  ...
  LOOP AT GROUP wa INTO DATA(member).
    ... member-... ...
  ENDLOOP.
  ...
ENDLOOP.
```

The member loop is executed using the group represented by `wa`
and its members are assigned to `member` and are available in
the member loop.

## Grouping by More than One Column

To group by more than just one criterion, a structured group key is
defined as follows. In the simplest case, the grouping criteria are
columns of the internal table:

``` abap
LOOP AT spfli_tab INTO wa 
                  GROUP BY ( key1 = wa-carrid key2 = wa-airpfrom ).
  ... wa-carrid ... wa-airpfrom ...
ENDLOOP.
```

This is also a representative binding in which the work area
`wa` is reused in the group loop to access the group key.

To access the members of the groups, the exact same member loop can be
inserted as when grouping by one column.

## Group Key Binding when Grouping by One Column

By explicitly specifying an [output
area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by_binding.htm)
for the group key, a group key binding can be defined explicitly instead
of the representative binding in which the output area of the group loop
is reused:

``` abap
LOOP AT spfli_tab INTO wa 
                  GROUP BY wa-carrid 
                  INTO DATA(key).
  ... key ...
ENDLOOP.
```

The difference to the example with representative binding is the
`INTO` addition after `GROUP BY`. Instead of reusing
`wa`, an elementary data object `key` represents the
group. This can be generated inline. The additions [`GROUP
SIZE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by_key.htm),
[`GROUP
INDEX`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by_key.htm),
and [`WITHOUT
MEMBERS`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by.htm)
can only be used in the group key binding, which gives it more functions
than the representative binding. If these are not required, the
representative binding can be used. The group key binding can also be
used to make the use of the group key in the loop more explicit.

Inserting a member loop works in the same way as in the representative
binding, with the difference that a group is now addressed by
`key` instead of `wa`.

``` abap
LOOP AT spfli_tab INTO wa 
                  GROUP BY wa-carrid 
                  INTO key.
  ...
  LOOP AT GROUP key INTO member.
    ... members ...
  ENDLOOP.
  ...
ENDLOOP.
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

## Group Key Binding when Grouping by More than One Column
Finally, the group key binding for structured group keys:

``` abap
LOOP AT spfli_tab INTO wa
                  GROUP BY ( key1 = wa-carrid key2 = wa-airpfrom )
                  INTO DATA(key).
  ... key-key1 ... key-key2 ...
ENDLOOP.
```

Here, `key` is a structure with the components `key1`
and `key2`. A member loop can be inserted in exactly the same
way as when grouping by one column.

If the group members are not relevant, the addition [`WITHOUT MEMBERS`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by.htm)
can be used to save time and memory.

``` abap
LOOP AT spfli_tab INTO wa
                  GROUP BY ( key1 = wa-carrid key2 = wa-airpfrom
                             index = GROUP INDEX size = GROUP SIZE )
                  WITHOUT MEMBERS
                  INTO DATA(key).
  ... key-key1 ... key-key2 ... key-index ... key-size ...
ENDLOOP.
```

It is no longer possible to use a member loop here. Instead, the group
key was enriched with optional components for further information using
[`GROUP
INDEX`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by_key.htm)
[`GROUP
SIZE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_group_by_key.htm).
