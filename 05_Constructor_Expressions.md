## Introduction

-   [Constructor
    expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    include a [constructor
    operator](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_operator_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    followed by the specification of a [data
    type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    or [object
    type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenobject_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    (or a `#` character that stands for such a type) and
    specific parameters specified within parentheses. Example using the
    `VALUE` operator:

    ``` abap
    ... VALUE some_type( ... ) ...
    ... VALUE #( ... ) ...
    ```

-   As the name implies, these expressions construct results of a
    specific type and their content. Either the type is specified
    explicitly before the first parenthesis or the said `#`
    character can be specified if the type can be derived implicitly
    from the [operand
    position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenoperand_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    The `#` character symbolizes the [operand
    type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenoperand_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    If no type can be derived from the operand position, for some
    constructor operators, the type can also be derived from the
    arguments in the parentheses.
-   Why use them? Constructor expressions can make your code leaner and
    more readable since you can achieve the same with fewer statements.
-   Apart from the concept of deriving types from the context, another
    concept is very handy particularly in this context: [Inline
    declaration](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninline_declaration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
    -   This means that you can declare a variable using
        `DATA(var)` (or an immutable variable
        [`FINAL(var)`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfinal_inline.htm))
        as an operand in the current [write
        position](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenwrite_position_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
        In doing so, such a variable declared inline can be given the
        appropriate type and result of the constructor expression in one
        go: ```DATA(strtable) = VALUE string_table( ( `a` ) ( `b` ) ( `c` ) ).``` or ```DATA(dec) = CONV decfloat34( '1.23' ).```.

> [!TIP]
>-  The construction of a result, i. e. a target [data
object](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
implies that the data object is initialized. However, for some
constructor operators, there is an addition with which the
initialization can be avoided.
>- As is true for many of the following syntax options, you can do a lot with constructor expressions, often with fewer lines (than older syntax equivalents) of code in a very elegant way. However, keep in mind the readability, maintainability, and debuggability of your code. For example, you can use iteration expressions instead of `LOOP` statements. The expressions are handy and more concise, but may be harder to read and they cannot be debugged.

## VALUE

-   Expressions with the
    [`VALUE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_value.htm)
    operator construct a result in place based on a data type.
-   This result can be structures or internal tables. It can also be initial values for any non-generic data types.   
    > [!NOTE] 
    > Elementary data types and reference types cannot be
    explicitly specified for the construction of values here.
-   Regarding the type specifications before and parameters within the
    parentheses:
    -   No parameter specified within the parentheses: The return value
        is set to its type-specific initial value. This is possible for
        any non-generic data types. See more information
        [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenvalue_constructor_params_init.htm).
    -   Structured and internal table type before the parentheses or
        `#` stands for such types: Individual components of
        structures can be specified as named arguments while each
        component of the return value can be assigned a data object that
        has the same data type as the component, or whose data type can
        be converted to this data type. See more information
        [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenvalue_constructor_params_struc.htm).
        To construct internal tables, you have multiple options, for
        example, you can add individual table lines using an inner pair
        of parentheses. More syntax options, for example, using the
        additions `BASE` and `FOR` are possible, too.
        See more information
        [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenvalue_constructor_params_itab.htm).
- As mentioned above, the concept of [inline declarations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninline_declarations.htm)
is very handy in this context. You can construct a new data object (for example, using `DATA(...)` or `FINAL(...)`), provide the desired type with the constructor expression and assign
values in one go.
- In case of [deep](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeep_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
and [nested structures](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abennested_structure_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
or [deep tables](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abendeep_table_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
the use of `VALUE` expressions is handy, too, because you can create corresponding values in place.

The following table illustrates a variety of syntax options and aspects regarding the `VALUE` operator. 

> [!NOTE] 
> - The examples represent a selection. Check the documentation for all options. 
> - Some of the additions and concepts mentioned here are also valid for other constructor expressions further down but not necessarily mentioned explicitly. See the details on the syntax
options of the constructor operators in the ABAP Keyword Documentation.

## CORRESPONDING

-   Expressions with the
    [`CORRESPONDING`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm)
    operator construct structures and internal tables based on a data
    type (i. e. a [table
    type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    or [structured
    type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstructured_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")).
-   The components or columns of the target data object are populated using
    assignments of the parameters specified within the parentheses.
-   The assignments are made using identical names or based on [mapping
    relationships](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abencorresponding_constr_mapping.htm)
-   Note: Pay attention to the [assignment and conversion
    rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconversion_rules.htm)
    to avoid errors when using the operator. Consider, for example, the
    impact of assigning the values of identically named fields having
    different types (e. g. one field is of type `c` and another
    field is of type `string`).

The following table includes a selection of various possible additions to
this operator. There are more variants available (also 
[RAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrap_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")-specific ones)
that are not covered here. Find more information in [this
topic](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_corresponding.htm) of the ABAP Keyword Documentation, and example snippets in the executable example.


| Addition  | Details |
|---|---|
| `BASE` | Keeps original values. Unlike, for example, the operator `VALUE`, a pair of parentheses must be set around `BASE`.  |
| `MAPPING`  | Enables the mapping of component names, i. e. a component of a source structure or source table can be assigned to a differently named component of a target structure or target table (e. g. `MAPPING c1 = c2`). The `DEFAULT` addition is possible when using the `MAPPING` addition. It allows the assignment of values for a target component based on an expression. Do not use the component selector `-` to refer to data objects in nested components in the mappings. |
| `EXCEPT`  | You can specify components that should not be assigned content in the target data object. They remain initial. In doing so, you exclude identically named components in the source and target object that are not compatible or convertible from the assignment to avoid syntax errors or runtime errors.  |
| `DISCARDING DUPLICATES`  | Relevant for tabular components. Handles duplicate lines and prevents exceptions when dealing with internal tables that have a unique primary or secondary table key. |
| `DEEP`  | Relevant for deep tabular components. They are resolved at every hierarchy level and identically named components are assigned line by line.  |
| `[DEEP] APPENDING`  | Relevant for (deep) tabular components. It ensures that the nested target tables are not deleted. The effect without `DEEP` is that lines of the nested source table are added using `CORRESPONDING` without addition. The effect with `DEEP` is that lines of the nested source table are added using `CORRESPONDING` with the addition `DEEP`.  |
| `DEEP`  | Relevant for deep tabular components. They are resolved at every hierarchy level and identically named components are assigned line by line.  |
| `FROM tab USING`  | Relevant for constructing an internal table by joining an internal table and a lookup table and comparing their components. |

> [!TIP]
> `CORRESPONDING` operator versus
[`MOVE-CORRESPONDING`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapmove-corresponding.htm) in the context of structures:
Although the functionality is the same, note that, as the name implies,
constructor operators construct and - without the addition
`BASE` - target objects are initialized. Hence, the following
two statements are  not the same:
>``` abap
>struc2 = CORRESPONDING #( struc1 ).
>
>"Not matching components are not initialized
>MOVE-CORRESPONDING struc1 TO struc2.
>```

**`CORRESPONDING` with lookup table**

- Constructs an internal table by joining an internal table and a lookup table and comparing their components
- Syntax pattern of the variant:  
    ```abap
    ... CORRESPONDING type|#( itab FROM lookup_tab 
                              USING [KEY key_name] a1 = b1 a2 = b2 ... 
                              [MAPPING ...] ) ...
    ```
- The resulting table is created as follows:
  - A search is performed on all lines in the internal table `itab`. They are matched to lines in the lookup table `lookup_tab` based on specifications after `USING`.
  - The search uses a sorted table key or hash key. If the key is not unique, the first matching line is used for the result.
  - If no match is found in the lookup table `lookup_tab`, the original line from the internal table `itab` is used for the result.
  - If a match is found, a `MOVE-CORRESPONDING` operation is implicitly performed and the line is assigned. However, the components that are used for the search are not assigned (to the identically named components) by default (see the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/abencorresponding_constr_using.html)).
  - Mapping rules specified after the optional `MAPPING` addition can modify the default assignments of identically named components.

- Usage hints:
  - To be used only with internal tables.
  - The target type must be a table type.
  - Tables in the `CORRESPONDING` expression must have structured line types.
  - The target internal table should match the type of `itab`.
  - The search must use a sorted table key or a hash key:
    - Omit the `KEY` addition only if the lookup table `lookup_tab` is sorted or hashed.
    - When using `KEY`, specify either:
      - A secondary key.
      - The primary key's default name `primary_key` or an alias, but only for sorted or hashed lookup tables.
  - When used:
    - Typically used for enriching the content of `itab` with content from `lookup_tab`, making `itab` the target table.
    - If `itab` is not used as the target or it is not statically known, a syntax check appears, which can be hidden with a pragma. In such an operation, a temporary copy of the values of the used internal table is created implicitly.

## NEW

-   Using the instance operator
    [`NEW`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_new.htm),
    you can create [anonymous data
    objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenanonymous_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    or
    [instances](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninstance_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    of a class and also assign values to the new object. As a result,
    you get a [reference
    variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenreference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    that points to the created object. In doing so, the operator
    basically replaces [`CREATE DATA`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapcreate_data.htm)
    and [`CREATE OBJECT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapcreate_object.htm).
-   For the type specification preceding the parentheses, you can use
    -   non-generic data types which creates a [data reference
        variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_reference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
        pointing to the anonymous data object.
    -   classes which creates objects of these classes. The result is an
        [object reference
        variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenobject_refer_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
        pointing to an object.
-   Regarding the created object reference variables, you can use the
    [object component
    selector](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenobject_component_select_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    `->` in certain contexts to ...
    -   point to a class attribute: `... NEW class( ... )->attr`
    -   introduce
        [standalone](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapcall_method_static_short.htm)
        and
        [functional](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapcall_method_functional.htm)
        method calls, including [chained method
        calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenchained_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
        which is a big advantage because you do not need to declare an
        extra variable: `... NEW class( ... )->meth( ... ) ...`
-   Regarding the type specifications before and parameters within the
    parentheses:
    -   No parameter specified within the parentheses: An anonymous data
        object retains its type-specific initial value. In case of
        classes, no parameter specification means that no values are
        passed to the instance constructor of an object. However, in
        case of mandatory [input
        parameters](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeninput_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"),
        the parameters must be specified.
    -   Single parameter specified: If the type specified before the
        parentheses is a non-generic elementary, structured, table, or a
        reference type (or such a type can be derived using
        `#`), a single data object can be specified as an
        unnamed argument. Note the [assignment
        rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconversion_rules.htm)
        regarding the value assignments within the parentheses and that
        a constructor expression itself can be specified there.
    -   Structures and internal tables specified: If the type specified
        before the parentheses is a structured data type or `#`
        stands for it, you can specify the individual components as
        named arguments (`comp1 = 1 comp2 = 2 ...`; see more
        information
        [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abennew_constructor_params_struct.htm)).
        For the construction of anonymous internal tables, multiple
        options are available. Among them, there is the use of
        `LET` and `FOR` expressions and others. See more
        details
        [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abennew_constructor_params_itab.htm).
    -   Classes: As mentioned, non-optional input parameters of the
        instance constructor of the instantiated class must be filled.
        No parameters are passed for a class without an explicit
        instance constructor. See more information:
        [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abennew_constructor_params_class.htm).
- The `NEW` operator is also covered as part of the [ABAP Object Orientation](04_ABAP_Object_Orientation.md) cheat sheet.

The following examples cover: 
- Creating anonymous data objects
- Creating objects/instances of classes

## CONV

-   The
    [`CONV`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_conv.htm)
    operator enforces conversions from one type to another and creates
    an appropriate result.
-   Note that the conversion is carried out according to [conversion
    rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconversion_rules.htm).
    -   Further [special
        rules](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconv_constructor_inference.htm)
        apply if the constructor expression is passed to an [actual
        parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenactual_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
        with a generically typed [formal
        parameter](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenformal_parameter_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   The operator is particularly suitable for avoiding the declaration
    of helper variables.

Constructing data objects

 </td>

As outlined above, you can construct structures and internal
tables using the `VALUE` operator. Using `VALUE` for
constructing [elementary data objects](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenelementary_data_object_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") and providing values is not possible. You can only use it to create a data object with an initial value, for example `DATA(str) = VALUE string( ).`. The `CONV` operator closes this gap. 

<br>

``` abap
DATA(a) = CONV decfloat34( '0.4' ).

"Instead of
DATA b TYPE decfloat34 VALUE '0.4'.

## EXACT

-   The
    [`EXACT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_exact.htm)
    operator enforces either a [lossless
    assignment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenlossless_move.htm)
    or a [lossless

## REF

-   The
    [`REF`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_ref.htm)
    operator creates a [data reference
    variable](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendata_reference_variable_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    pointing to a specified data object.
-   The type specified after `REF` and directly before the first
    parenthesis determines the [static
    type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstatic_type_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    of the result.
-   The operator replaces [`GET REFERENCE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapget_reference.htm), which should not be used anymore,
    and is particularly useful for avoiding the declaration of helper
    variables that are only necessary, for example, to specify data
    reference variables as actual parameters.
- The following can be specified after `REF` before the first parenthesis: A non-generic data type that satisfies the rules of [upcasts in data references](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconversion_references_data.htm), the generic type `data`, the `#` character if the type can be derived from the context.

Examples:
``` abap
"Data references
"Declaring data object and assign value
DATA num TYPE i VALUE 5.

"Declaring data reference variable
DATA dref_a TYPE REF TO i.

"Getting references
dref_a = REF #( num ).

"Inline declaration
DATA(dref_b) = REF #( `hallo` ).
"Inline declaration and explicit type specification
DATA(dref_c) = REF abap_bool( 'X' ).

"Specifying table expressions as arguments. The example code includes
"additions to avoid an exception if table lines are not found.
DATA int_tab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.
int_tab = VALUE #( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ).
DATA(dref_d) = REF #( int_tab[ 2 ] ).
DATA(dref_e) = REF #( int_tab[ 6 ] OPTIONAL ). "Initial reference variable
DATA(dref_f) = REF #( int_tab[ 7 ] DEFAULT NEW #( 123 ) ). "Providing a default value

"Object references
DATA(oref_a) = NEW zcl_demo_abap_objects( ).
DATA(oref_b) = REF #( oref_a ).
```

<p align="right"><a href="#top">⬆️ back to top</a></p>

## CAST

-   Using the
    [`CAST`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_cast.htm)
    operator, you can carry out
    [upcasts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenup_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    and
    [downcasts](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abendown_cast_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    and create a reference variable of a static type as a result.
-   It replaces the
    [`?=`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapmove_cast.htm)
    operator and enables [chained method
    calls](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenchained_method_call_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry").
-   The operator is particularly helpful for avoiding the declaration of
    helper variables and more contexts.
-   Similar to the `NEW` operator, constructor expressions with
    `CAST` can be followed by the object component selector
    `->` to point to a class or interface attribute (`... CAST class( ... )->attr`) and methods (`... CAST class( ...
    )->meth( ... )`). Method chaining, standalone and
    functional method calls are possible, too. See more information
    [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_cast.htm).
- Find more examples on using the `CAST` operator, up- and downcasts in the [ABAP Object Orientation](04_ABAP_Object_Orientation.md#demonstrating-upcasts-and-downcasts-using-the-rtts-inheritance-tree) cheat sheet.

Examples:
``` abap
"Performing casts on arguments and creating a reference variable that has the
"static type as specified as a result.

"Declaring data reference variables
DATA ref_i TYPE REF TO i.
DATA ref_gen TYPE REF TO data. "Generic type

"Creating an anonymous data object
ref_i = NEW #( 789 ).

"Upcast
"Static type of the target is less specific than or the same as the static
"type of the source
ref_gen = ref_i.
"The CAST operator can also be specified for upcasts. In this case, it can but
"need not be specified.
ref_gen = CAST #( ref_i ).

"Downcast
"Static type of the target is more specific than the static type of the source
"A check must be made at runtime before the assignment is done. If you indeed
"want to trigger such a downcast, you must do it explicitly in your code, for
"example, using the CAST operator (older operator: ?=).

"A syntax error occurs for the first statement. An explicit casting is required.
"ref_i = ref_gen.
ref_i = CAST #( ref_gen ).

"Like a data reference variable, the expressions can be followed by the
"dereferencing operator
ref_gen = NEW string( `hi` ).
CAST string( ref_gen )->* = `abap`.
DATA(str) = CAST string( ref_gen )->*.

"In case of static structured types, you can use the object component
"selector (->).
ref_gen = NEW zdemo_abap_carr( ).
CAST zdemo_abap_carr( ref_gen )->carrid = 'XY'.
DATA(comp) = CAST zdemo_abap_carr( ref_gen )->carrid.
"Dynamic specifications are possible.
CAST zdemo_abap_carr( ref_gen )->('CARRID') = 'ZZ'.
DATA(dyncomp) = |{ CAST zdemo_abap_carr( ref_gen )->('CARRID') }|.

"In the context of RTTS (see the cheat sheet about dynamic programming),
"helper variables are often required to perform a downcast of a type description
"object to a specialized class. The following examples, show how such helper
"variables can be reduced by using statements with CAST.
"Getting component information

## COND

- The [`COND`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconditional_expression_cond.htm) operator is used for creating a result depending on [logical expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenlogical_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") 
- It can also be used to raise [class-based exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenclass_based_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [runtime errors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenruntime_error_glosry.htm) with the [`THROW`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconditional_expression_result.htm) addition.
  - Find examples on the `THROW` addition in the [Exceptions and Runtime Errors](27_Exceptions.md) cheat sheet.
- There can be multiple logical expressions initiated by `WHEN` followed by the result specified after `THEN`. If none of the logical expressions are true, you can
    specify an `ELSE` clause at the end. If this clause is not specified, the result is the initial value of the specified or derived data type.
- Note that all operands specified after `THEN` must be convertible to the specified or derived data type.

## SWITCH

- The [`SWITCH`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconditional_expression_switch.htm) operator is fairly similar to the `COND` operator and works in the style of [`CASE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapcase.htm) statements, i. e. it uses the value of only a single variable that is checked in the case distinction.
- Also here, `SWITCH` can be used to raise [class-based exceptions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenclass_based_exception_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or [runtime errors](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenruntime_error_glosry.htm) with the [`THROW`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconditional_expression_result.htm) addition. Find examples on the `THROW` addition in the [Exceptions and Runtime Errors](27_Exceptions.md) cheat sheet.

Examples:

``` abap
"The following example performs a calculation (no error handling implemented)
"if a valid operator is passed, and stores the result in a data object of
"type string.
"Note: Similar to the COND operator, the THROW addition is also possible
"for the SWITCH operator.
DATA(operator) = '*'.
DATA(num1) = 5.
DATA(num2) = 7.
DATA(calc_result) = SWITCH #( operator
                              WHEN '+' THEN |{ num1 + num2 STYLE = SIMPLE }|

                              WHEN '*' THEN |{ num1 * num2 STYLE = SIMPLE }|
                              WHEN '/' THEN |{ CONV decfloat34( num1 / num2 ) STYLE = SIMPLE }|
                              ELSE `Wrong operator.` ).

"A constructor expression as above instead of, for example, a CASE statement as follows.

  WHEN OTHERS.
   calc_result = `Wrong operator.`.
ENDCASE.
```

## FILTER

-   The
    [`FILTER`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_filter.htm) operator constructs an internal table according to a specified type (which can be an explicitly specified, non-generic table type or the `#` character as a symbol for the [operand type](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenoperand_type_glosry.htm) before the first parenthesis).
- The lines for the new internal table are taken from an
    existing internal table based on conditions specified in a `WHERE` condition. Note that the table type of the existing internal table must be convertible to the specified target type.
-   The conditions can either be based on single values or a [filter
    table](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_filter_table.htm).
- The source table must have at least one [sorted key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensorted_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") or a [hash key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenhash_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") for accessing. If the table does not have such a primary table key, a [secondary table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensecondary_table_key_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") must be available.
- Syntax options for using the table key (i.e. specifying its components):
  - Using the [primary table key](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenprimary_table_key_glosry.htm) without the `USING KEY` addition
  - Using the default name `primary_key` for the primary key with `USING KEY`
  - Using the secondary table key with `USING KEY`
- Notes on the `WHERE` condition: 
  - The conditions for the table key components can be specified as follows: 
    - Hash keys: Only the comparison operator `=` is allowed
    - Sorted key: `=`/`EQ`, `<>`/`NE`, `<`/`LT`, `>`/`GT`, `<=`/`LE`, `>=`/`GE`
    - When filtering using single values, you can also use `IS [NOT] INITIAL`.
  - Multiple comparisons can be combined using `AND`; boolean operators such as `NOT` or `OR` cannot be specified.
- Notes on the filter table: 
  - The line types of the source and filter table need not be identical.
  - Refer to the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expr_filter_table.htm) for all syntax options. For example, depending on where `USING KEY` is specified, the table key is specified for the source or filter table for the access.
- Notes on the `EXCEPT` addition: The specification of `EXCEPT` means that those lines of the table are used that do not meet the condition specified in the `WHERE` condition. Therefore, if `EXCEPT` is not specified, the lines of the table are used that meet the condition.

## LET Expressions

- Define one or more variables (field symbols are also possible) as local (i.e. local to the expression) helper fields and assigns values to them.
- In the definition, the right-hand side value is declared as if an inline declaration is used. The data type is derived accordingly. 
- Only to be used in constructor expressions (see the syntax diagrams in the ABAP Keyword Documentation where exactly [`LET`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaplet.htm) expressions can be specified).

See the following examples to get an idea about the use:

## Iteration Expressions

- Iteration expressions are expressions ...
  - that perform an iteration and that are possible in specific constructor expressions (`NEW`, `VALUE`, `REDUCE`).
  - that are introduced by the iteration operator `FOR`. 
  - that can optionally be used to create lines in internal tables. 
- `REDUCE` operator: Special reduction operator that is based on [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"), i.e. it is mandatory to specify iteration expressions with `FOR` when using `REDUCE`.

### Iteration Expressions Using FOR

- Two flavors for iterations using [`FOR`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfor.htm):
  - [Conditional iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenfor_conditional.htm)
    (including the ABAP words `UNTIL` and `WHILE` which
    have the semantics of the ABAP statements
    [`DO`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapdo.htm)
    and
    [`WHILE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abapwhile.htm))    
  - [Table iterations](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abentable_iteration_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry"): 
    Have the semantics of [`LOOP AT`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abaploop_at_itab_variants.htm) and 
    include the addition `IN`.
-   Where possible:
    - `REDUCE`: Mandatory `FOR` specification. The reduction result is created in the
       iteration steps. 
    - `NEW` and `VALUE`: Optional `FOR` specification. Used in the context of
        looping across internal tables. New table lines are created in
        the iteration steps and inserted into a target table.
-   The operand specified after `FOR` represents an iteration
    variable, i. e. a [work area](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenwork_area_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry")
    that contains the data while looping across the table.
-   This variable is only visible within the `FOR`
    expression, i. e. it cannot be used outside of the expression.
-   The type of the variable is determined by the type of the internal
    table specified after `IN`.
-   One or more iteration expressions can be specified using
    `FOR`.
-   The components or the whole table line that is to be returned are
    specified within the pair of parentheses before the closing
    parenthesis.
-   In contrast to `LOOP` statements, the sequential processing
    cannot be debugged.
- Using `INDEX INTO n`, you can store the `sy-tabix` value for each loop iteration. The following variable is implicitly of type `i`. 
- `LET` expressions following `FOR` are evaluated during each iteration of the loop.

### REDUCE

-   The
    [`REDUCE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenconstructor_expression_reduce.htm)
    operator creates a result of a specified or derived type from one or
    more [iteration expressions](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abeniteration_expression_glosry.htm "Glossary Entry") with `FOR`.
-   As covered for `FOR`, conditional iterations (reducing sets of data objects to a single data object in custom iteration steps) and table iterations (evaluation of table lines, reducing the table content to summary value) are possible. For example, the numeric values of a table column are summed up. As a result, the total number is constructed. 
- Additions: 
  - Optional `LET` expressions (the following additions are mandatory)
  - `INIT ...`: A temporary variable (or field symbol) to specify an initial value for the result variable. At least, one variable/field symbol must be specified. The first specified determines the result of the expression (any others that are additionally specified can be used after `NEXT`).
  - `FOR ...`: Iteration expression as covered above.
  - `NEXT ...`: Represents the assignment to the temporary variable after every iteration. Once the loop has finished, the target variable is assigned the resulting value.

### Grouping Lines in Internal Tables with VALUE/REDUCE

Find more information in the [Internal Tables: Grouping](11_Internal_Tables_Grouping.md) cheat sheet.

Examples: 

```abap
"Data objects and types to work with in the examples
TYPES: BEGIN OF s,
          col1 TYPE c LENGTH 5,
          col2 TYPE i,

       END OF s.
TYPES itab_type TYPE TABLE OF s WITH EMPTY KEY.
DATA(itab) = VALUE itab_type( ( col1 = 'a' col2 = 1 col3 = 30 )
                              ( col1 = 'bb' col2 = 2 col3 = 10 )
                              ( col1 = 'ccc' col2 = 3 col3 = 20 ) ).

"The following examples show equivalents of LOOP AT GROUP ... GROUP BY ... statements.

"Constructing a result using VALUE
"The following example returns the values of identified groups in an internal table
"Table lines are evaluated by grouping all lines that meet the condition
"specified in GROUP BY (group key binding). The group key is stored in the variable
"after FOR GROUPS (gr). The constructed result just consists of the group keys in
"the example. The content of the members is not relevant.
DATA(it_val_1) = VALUE string_table( FOR GROUPS gr OF wa IN itab4grp
                                     GROUP BY wa-col1 ASCENDING
                                     WITHOUT MEMBERS
                                     ( |{ gr }| ) ).

*a
*b
*c

"As above, the following example returns the values of identified groups in an internal table.
"Additionally, a LET expression (that itself contains an iteration expression) is specified
"to collect column values by group in an internal table. The lines of this (string) table

    ( |{ grp }: { concat_lines_of( table = members sep = ` / ` ) }| ) ).

*a: 1, 2 / 3, 4 / 5, 6
*b: 7, 8 / 9, 10
*c: 11, 12

"Constructing a result using REDUCE
"The example is similar to the previous one by filling a string table.
"The example uses a group key expression specified after GROUP BY.
"In the group key expression, additional components of a structured
"group key are specified which return specific information (group size,
"group index).
