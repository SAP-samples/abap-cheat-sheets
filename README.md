## üé¨ Getting Started with the Examples

The executable examples are implemented in classes to be fit for both on-premise systems and the SAP BTP ABAP environment. Hence, check the info in the following collapsible sections for your system environment and carry out the prerequisite steps.

<details>
  <summary>1) General info</summary>
  <br>

- A few **DDIC artifacts**, for example, database tables, are part of the repository. They are used by the examples to ensure self-contained examples. For all examples to work, all artifacts must be imported.
- All examples are designed to **display some output in the ADT console**. Once successfully imported, you can **execute** the examples in ADT by choosing `F9` to display the output in the ADT console.
- The examples **include descriptions and comments** in the code for providing explanations and setting the context.

  <br>

**Prerequisites**
- [x] Before importing the code, you have made a system-wide search for, for example, classes named `ZCL_DEMO_ABAP*` so as not to run into issues when you try to import the code. If someone has already imported the content in the system, you can simply check out that imported version and proceed with the step *3) Run the code*.
- [x] You have access to an SAP BTP ABAP Environment instance (see [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/09/04/sap-cloud-platform-abap-environment) for additional information).
- [x] You have downloaded and installed ABAP Development Tools (ADT). Make sure that you use the most recent version as indicated on the [installation page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap).
- [x] You have created an ABAP cloud project in ADT that allows you to access your SAP BTP ABAP Environment instance (see [here](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/99cc54393e4c4e77a5b7f05567d4d14c.html) for additional information). Your logon language is English.
- [x] You have installed the [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/eclipse.abapgit.org) plug-in for ADT from the [update site](http://eclipse.abapgit.org/updatesite/).

**Import Code**

Use the abapGit plug-in to install the <em>ABAP Cheat Sheets</em> by carrying out the following steps:

1. In your ABAP cloud project, create a package, for example, `ZABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS` as target package. It is recommended that you assign the package to a transport request suitable for demo content.
2. Add the package to the *Favorite Packages* in the *Project Explorer* view in ADT.
3. To add the <em>abapGit Repositories</em> view to the <em>ABAP</em> perspective, choose `Window` ‚Üí `Show View` ‚Üí `Other...` from the menu bar and choose `abapGit Repositories`.
4. On the <em>abapGit Repositories</em> view, click the `+` icon in the top right corner of the ADT tab to link a new abapGit repository.
  <br>![ADT](./files/abapGit_Repositories.png)

5. The *Link abapGit Repository* pop-up is displayed. Insert the following URL:

```
https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-cheat-sheets.git
```

6. Choose `Next`.

7. On the *Branch and Package Selection* screen, insert the name of the created package (e. g. `ZABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS`) in the `Package` field.
8. Choose `Next`.
9.  On the *Select Transport Request* screen, select the created transport request suitable for demo content and choose `Finish` to link the Git repository to your ABAP cloud project. If the created package is already assigned to a transport request for the demo content and a message that an object is already locked in a transport request is displayed, choose `Finish`, too.
10. In the *abapGit Repositories* view, filter for your package. The repository appears in the *abapGit Repositories* view with status <em>Linked</em>.
11. Right-click the new abapGit repository and choose `Pull...` to start the cloning of the repository contents.
12. On the *Branch and Package Selection* screen, choose `Next`.
13. If the *Locally Modified Object* screen is displayed, select the objects (for example, the package to automatically select all artifacts) in the list and choose `Next`.
14. On the next screen, select a transport request and choose `Finish`. Same as above, if an *object already locked* message is displayed, choose `Finish`, too. The status in the *abapGit Repositories* view changes to <em>Pull running...</em>. Note that the pull run may take a few minutes.
15. Once the cloning has finished, the status is set to `Pulled Successfully`. You might need to refresh the `abapGit Repositories` view to see the progress of the import. To do so, choose the icon for refreshing (`Refresh`) in the top right corner of the view.
16. Refresh your project tree. E. g. in ADT, right-click the package and choose `Refresh` or `F5`. The package should contain all artifacts from the GitHub repository.
17. Make sure that all artifacts are active. To activate all inactive development objects, choose the `Activate all inactive ABAP development objects` button from the menu (or choose `CTRL+Shift+F3`).

  <summary>2b) Application Server ABAP On-Premise</summary>
<br>

**Prerequisites**
- [x] Before importing the code, you have made a system-wide search for, for example, classes named `ZCL_DEMO_ABAP*` so as not to run into issues when you try to import the code. If someone has already imported the content in the system, you can simply check out that imported version and proceed with the step *3) Run the code*.
- [x] You have downloaded and installed ABAP Development Tools (ADT). Make sure that you use the most recent version as indicated on the [installation page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap).
- [x] You have created an ABAP Project in ADT that allows you to access your Application Server as mentioned above. Your logon language is English.
- [x] You have downloaded and installed the standalone version of the abapGit report. Make sure that you use the most recent version as indicated on the [installation page](https://docs.abapgit.org/). You can create a report, for example, `zabapgit_standalone` and copy and paste [this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abapGit/build/main/zabapgit_standalone.prog.abap) into the program.
- [x] You have installed the certificate files for github.com, see [abapGit Documentation](https://docs.abapgit.org/guide-ssl-setup.html).

**Import Code**

Use the standalone version of the abapGit report to import the demo examples of the <em>ABAP Cheat Sheets</em> by carrying out the following steps:
1. In your ABAP project, create a package, for example, `TEST_ABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS` as target package suitable for demo content (e. g. by using `LOCAL` as software component).
2. Add the package to the *Favorite Packages* in the *Project Explorer* view in ADT.
3. Run the standalone version of the abapGit report.
4. Choose the `New Online` button. If the button is not available, for example, if another repository is already opened, choose the `Repository List` button.
5. On the *New Online Repository* screen, make the following entries:
   - `Git Repository URL`:

      ```
      https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-cheat-sheets.git
      ```

   - `Package`: Your demo package, for example, `TEST_ABAP_CHEAT_SHEETS`
6. Leave the other fields unchanged and choose `Create Online Repo`.
7. On the *Repository* screen, you will see the available ABAP artifacts to be imported into your ABAP system.
8.  Choose the `Pull` button. The import of the artifacts is triggered. It might take some minutes.
9. If the `Inactive Objects` pop-up is displayed, select all artifacts and choose `Continue` (‚úîÔ∏è).
10.	Once the cloning has finished, refresh your project tree. E. g. in ADT, right-click the package and choose `Refresh` or `F5`. The package should contain all artifacts from the GitHub repository.
11. Make sure that all artifacts are active. To activate all inactive development objects, choose the `Activate all inactive ABAP development objects` button from the (or choose `CTRL+Shift+F3`).

<details>
  <summary>3) Run the code</summary>
<br>

- Open your created package containing the imported ABAP artifacts in the ABAP Development Tools (ADT).
- Open an ABAP cheat sheet example class as listed in the [ABAP Cheat Sheets Overview](#üìù-abap-cheat-sheets-overview) section, for example, `zcl_demo_abap_string_proc`. The classes are contained in folder `Source Code Library` ‚Üí `Classes`.
- Choose `F9` to run the class. Alternatively, choose `Run` ‚Üí `Run As` ‚Üí `2 ABAP Application (Console)` from the menu.
- Check the console output.

> **üí° Note**<br>
>- Check notes on the context and the ABAP syntax used included in the class as comments.
>- Due to the amount of output in the console, the examples include numbers (e. g. 1) ..., 2) ..., 3) ...) representing the header of the individual example code sections. Plus, the variable name is displayed in the console in most cases. Hence, to easier and faster find the relevant output in the console, just search in the console for the number (e. g. search for `3)` for the particular output) or variable name (`STRG+F` in the console) or use break points in the code to check variables in the debugger.
>- You might want to clear the console by making a right-click within the console and choosing `Clear` before running another demo class so as not to confuse the output of multiple classes.

## ‚ö° Known issues
- Only one user on the system may import this repository as all object names must be globally unique. If you receive an error that the objects already exist when trying to import, search the system for classes named `ZCL_DEMO_ABAP*`. Someone has already imported the content in the system and you can simply check out that imported version.
- Since the repository contains self-contained examples, i. e. they work, for example, with demo database tables included in the repository (note that these tables are filled in the course of method executions), all demo artifacts must be imported so that all examples work.
- For the use in an on-premise system, note the following: The demos cover ABAP syntax irrespective of the release and may include syntax that is not yet available with the ABAP version of your on-premise system. In that case, you might want to comment out affected code sections if an activation fails.
- Regarding potential code check warnings, for example, for the many strings in the code, not using an `ORDER BY` clause or messages regarding using `SELECT *`, the code purposely renounces pragmas and pseudo comments to keep the code fairly simple and to focus on the available ABAP syntax. See the [Disclaimer](#‚ö†Ô∏è-disclaimer).

## üõà Further information
- Regarding the system-internal version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation in your
  - ... **on-premise system**: Access the documentation in SAP GUI via the transactions `ABAPDOCU` (opens the documentation directly) and `ABAPHELP` (opens an input field with which you can search the documentation content, for example, you can search for a keyword like `SELECT`). Or, certainly, in your code, choose `F1` for a keyword. If you are in SAP GUI (e. g. in `SE80`), the system-internal version is opened. If you are in ADT, the documentation is opened in the *ABAP Language Help* view.
  - ... **SAP BTP ABAP environment**: In ADT, you find the documentation in the *ABAP Language Help* view where you can also search. When choosing `F1` for a keyword in your code, the documentation is opened there accordingly.
- Links to the online version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation for:
  - **Standard ABAP**: Unrestricted ABAP language scope, for example, for developments in an on-premise ABAP system ‚Üí [Online version of the documentation (latest version)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap.htm)
