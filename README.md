## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
The code examples presented in this repository are only syntax examples and are not intended for direct use in a production system environment. The code examples are primarily intended to provide a better explanation and visualization of the syntax and semantics of ABAP statements and not to solve concrete programming tasks. For production application programs, a dedicated solution should therefore always be worked out for each individual case.
There is no guarantee for either the correctness or the completeness of the code. In addition, there is no legal responsibility or liability for possible errors or their consequences, which occur through the use of the example code.
