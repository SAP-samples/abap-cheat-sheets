- [ABAP Release News](#abap-release-news)
  - [ABAP for Cloud Development Documentation Release News](#abap-for-cloud-development-documentation-release-news)
  - [Standard ABAP Documentation Release News](#standard-abap-documentation-release-news)

This ABAP cheat sheet summarizes the release news from the ABAP Keyword Documentation for both versions of the ABAP language: ABAP for Cloud Development and Standard ABAP. It organizes the information by release and topic, such as ABAP SQL and ABAP CDS. This cheat sheet is intended to collect ABAP news, enabling quick browsing and research on new features and changes by release and topic.

> [!NOTE]  
>
> - ABAP releases are identified by numbers such as 7.58, 7.95, 7.96, 9.12, and so on. These numbers correspond to the technical release names of the *SAP_BASIS* software component. ABAP is not released independently; it is included with SAP products like the SAP BTP ABAP environment, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition and SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. Each of these products has its own release numbers that correspond to the ABAP releases. The releases of the underlying ABAP kernel are counted differently but can also be mapped to the ABAP releases. The numbers in brackets describe quarterly releases.
> - The content is presented in a simplified, plain text format. You can also check out the demo HTML file mentioned below.  
> - For a complete overview and links to related topics, and since **the content may not reflect the latest releases or news**, refer to the release news in the ABAP Keyword Documentation here:

MAILBOX If set to X, the ABAP Keyword Documentation display offers a function to send a feedback mail to abap.docu@exchange.sap.corp. This mailbox is only available to SAP employees. Therefore, the setting makes sense for SAP's own development systems only. Recommendation: Set to X in SAP's own development systems. Set to initial in all other systems. VERSION Determines the ABAP language version for which the ABAP Keyword Documentation is displayed. Allowed values are defined in domain ABAPVRS. This setting can be overridden when calling the documentation using the respective APIs: CL_ABAP_DOCU for the SAP GUI version CL_ABAP_DOCU_EXTERNAL for the ADT or Web version. Calls to the documentation from ABAP Workbench and ADT set the language version depending on the object currently being edited. Calls to the documentation via the ABAPDOCU and ABAPHELP transactions use the version from ABDOCCONFIG by default. An initial value for VERSION in ABDOCCONFIG displays the documentation for Standard ABAP (X). Recommendation: Set to X in SAP S/4HANA Set to 5 in SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Program ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG allows a choice to be made between different sets of parameters: Parameter set typical for SAP development systems Parameter set typical for customer development systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP environment Parameter set typical for SAP BTP ABAP environment Current parameter set The passed parameters are used as default values for a dialog window and can be overridden there. If customizing table ABDOCCONFIG is initial in a customer system, the first call of the ABAP Keyword documentation supplies it with values recommended for an SAP S/4HANA System. In SAP's own systems, values for a SAP development system are supplied. If the table is partly filled, default values are used for the missing rows. These values are initial for all properties except VERSION. If the language version is not passed by the caller and cannot be found in ABDOCCONFIG, the value X is used and a warning is shown in the documentation display. </td>

            <td>Convertibility of Structures</td>
            <td>The conversion rules for flat structures are based on their fragment views, where each alignment gap is considered as a fragment. Alignment gaps arise from the alignment requirements of the component's data types. For character-like components, the alignment requirement depends on the character representation: For character representation UCS-2 used by the ABAP programming language, the memory address of character-like data objects must be divisible by 2. For other character representations there are other alignment requirements. For example, the non-Unicode character representation ASCII has no alignment requirement while the Unicode character representation UTF-32 requires a divisibility by 4. Meanwhile, only Unicode systems are supported. The system code page is UTF-16 and its subset UCS-2 is supported in the ABAP language. Any character is represented by 2 bytes and the alignment requirement is always a divisibility by 2. Because of this, the conversion rules for flat structures can be less strict than before and the new determination of possible alignment gaps was introduced in ABAP release 7.73. Example For example, the following assignment between two flat structures was not possible before ABAP release 7.73 but is possible now. TYPES:   BEGIN OF incl1,     num TYPE i,     c2  TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF incl1. DATA:   BEGIN OF struc1,     c1 TYPE c LENGTH 2.     INCLUDE TYPE incl1. DATA:     c3 TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF struc1. DATA:   BEGIN OF struc2,     c1  TYPE c LENGTH 2,     num TYPE i,     c2  TYPE c LENGTH 2,     c3  TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF struc2. struc1 = struc2. In the included substructure incl1, the character component has the same alignment as the integer component and there is no alignment gap. As long as non-Unicode Systems were supported, however, an alignment gap had to be assumed behind the included structure in order to make the program executable in Unicode systems as well as in non-Unicode Systems. </td>

The annotation was used before Release 7.58 to define the key fields of the CDS-managed DDIC view of an obsolete CDS DDIC-based view. The annotation can be kept in existing data definitions, but it no longer has an effect any more and leads to a syntax check warning. The key fields of the CDS-managed DDIC view are always defined by the addition key in the SELECT list. The change in behavior between 7.57 and 7.58 is incompatible. The key fields of the CDS-managed DDIC view of an obsolete CDS DDIC-based view are defined differently now for views where the annotation was not specified or where it was specified with the value false. The value false was used to define the key fields of the CDS-managed DDIC view as for a DDIC database views in ABAP Dictionary, regardless of the addition KEY.

            <td>From release 7.56 on, important settings of the ABAP Keyword Documentation can be configured explicitly. Before, the documentation was configured implicitly from system settings. The configuration of the ABAP Keyword Documentation is saved in customizing table ABDOCCONFIG, that is maintained with transaction code ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG (based on executable program ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG) or with the configuration entity ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG_ENTITY. All repository objects related to the configuration are documented. The following properties can be set: CP If set to X, the ABAP Keyword Documentation uses terms appropriate for the SAP BTP ABAP environment (aka Steampunk) instead of Application Server ABAP in some footers and copyright texts. Recommendation: Set to X in systems of the SAP BTP ABAP environment. Set to initial in all other systems. ICF Enables or disables the Web Version of the ABAP Keyword Documentation based on ICF nodes /sap/public/bc/abap/docu and /sap/bc/abap/docu. The following settings can be applied: If set to X, the Web Version is enabled. The execution of example programs from the Web Version is disabled. If set to E, the Web Version is enabled. The execution of example programs from the Web Version is also enabled. Recommendation: Set to E in SAP development systems. Set to E in customer development systems. Set to X in SAP S/4HANA. Set to initial in SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud. BATCH If set to X, the infrastructure of the ABAP Keyword Documentation is allowed to start batch jobs that prepare buffers that are needed for search in and display of the documentation. Recommendation: Set to X in SAP S/4HANA. Set to initial in SAP BTP ABAP environment. MAILBOX If set to X, the ABAP Keyword Documentation display offers a function to send a feedback mail to abap.docu@exchange.sap.corp. This mailbox is only available to SAP employees. Therefore, the setting makes sense for SAP's own development systems only. Recommendation: Set to X in SAP's own development systems. Set to initial in all other systems. VERSION Determines the ABAP language version for which the ABAP Keyword Documentation is displayed. Allowed values are defined in domain ABAPVRS. This setting can be overridden when calling the documentation using the respective APIs: CL_ABAP_DOCU for the SAP GUI version CL_ABAP_DOCU_EXTERNAL for the ADT or Web version. Calls to the documentation from ABAP Workbench and ADT set the language version depending on the object currently being edited. Calls to the documentation via the ABAPDOCU and ABAPHELP transactions use the version from ABDOCCONFIG by default. An initial value for VERSION in ABDOCCONFIG displays the documentation for Standard ABAP (X). Recommendation: Set to X in SAP S/4HANA Set to 5 in SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Program ABAP_DOCU_CONFIG allows a choice to be made between different sets of parameters: Parameter set typical for SAP development systems Parameter set typical for customer development systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA systems Parameter set typical for SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP environment Parameter set typical for SAP BTP ABAP environment Current parameter set The passed parameters are used as default values for a dialog window and can be overridden there. If customizing table ABDOCCONFIG is initial in a customer system, the first call of the ABAP Keyword documentation supplies it with values recommended for an SAP S/4HANA System. In SAP's own systems, values for a SAP development system are supplied. If the table is partly filled, default values are used for the missing rows. These values are initial for all properties except VERSION. If the language version is not passed by the caller and cannot be found in ABDOCCONFIG, the value X is used and a warning is shown in the documentation display. </td>

Outside the strict modes, they produced a syntax check warning and in most cases a runtime error when the program was executed. When a view is accessed, its key fields must be located together at the start. The additions USING CLIENT and CLIENT SPECIFIED cannot be used when a CDS entity is accessed that is associated with a CDS role. Even when using path expressions, the addition CLIENT SPECIFIED can only be used for client-specific data sources. When a column is specified, the actual names of the components must be used for a database table containing an include structure, and not the names of any groups defined in ABAP Dictionary. An alternative column name of the SELECT list defined using AS can have a maximum of 30 characters. Alternative column names with more than 30 characters are also not allowed after ORDER BY. Columns of the types LCHR and LRAW can be read in a query only if they are read together with the associated length fields. The following applies when using FOR ALL ENTRIES in the SELECT statement: The decimal places in the comparisons between columns of a data source and columns of the internal table of type p must match. All columns of the primary key specified after ORDER BY using PRIMARY KEY must also occur in the SELECT list. The pseudo component table_line can be specified only for internal tables with an elementary row type. A GROUP BY grouping must be applied to columns specified after HAVING outside aggregate functions. The same applies to columns specified directly in the SELECT list when a HAVING clause is specified, but that are not specified after GROUP BY. If a SELECT list is specified as *, a HAVING clause can only be used together with a GROUP BY clause. If an alternative name is used after ORDER BY, this name must be unique and cannot be the same name as a column that does not have any alternative names. A work area wa specified in the INTO clause has fewer components than explicit columns in the SELECT list.

In AMDP function implementations for CDS table functions, however, the restriction that only elementary input parameters are allowed still applies. Tabular input parameters of AMDP procedure implementations and of AMDP function implementations can now be made optional using OPTIONAL, but it is still not possible to specify a start value with DEFAULT. When a replacement parameter declared using DEFAULT is specified for an elementary input parameter of an AMDP method, the following (previously undocumented) restrictions were lifted: Constants declared using the addition VALUE IS INITIAL can now be specified for the data types d, t, and x. This previously produced a syntax error. Constants declared using the addition VALUE '00010101' can now be specified for the data type d, or the literal '00010101' can be specified directly. Both previously produced a syntax error. Constants declared by specifying numeric literals after VALUE and whose lengths are not precisely 8 or 6 can now be specified for the data types d and t. This previously produced a syntax error. Until now, values of literals with lengths of precisely 8 or 6 were handled like a string. This incorrect behavior was also modified and the numeric value is handled as the number of days since 01.01.001 or as the number of seconds since 00:00:00. This modification is incompatible if an AMDP procedure or function with an input parameter of this type is called from other database procedures or functions without an actual parameter being assigned to the parameter in question. In AMDP methods, the addition DEFAULT now behaves in the same way as in regular methods. It still cannot be specified for the data types string, xstring, decfloat16, and decfloat34, however, and no literals can be specified that cannot be converted into the data type of the input parameter. </td>

            <td>Convertibility of Structures</td>
            <td>The conversion rules for flat structures are based on their fragment views, where each alignment gap is considered as a fragment. Alignment gaps arise from the alignment requirements of the component's data types. For character-like components, the alignment requirement depends on the character representation: For character representation UCS-2 used by the ABAP programming language, the memory address of character-like data objects must be divisible by 2. For other character representations there are other alignment requirements. For example, the non-Unicode character representation ASCII has no alignment requirement while the Unicode character representation UTF-32 requires a divisibility by 4. Before only Unicode systems were supported, the conversion rules for structures had to take all possible alignment requirements for characters into account, regardless of the actual length of a character in its character representation. Meanwhile, only Unicode systems are supported. The system codepage is UTF-16 and its subset UCS-2 is supported in ABAP language. Any character is represented by 2 bytes and the alignment requirement is always a divisibility by 2. Because of this, the conversion rules for flat structures can be less strict than before and the new determination of possible alignment gaps was introduced in ABAP release 7.53. Example For example, the following assignment between two flat structures was not possible before ABAP release 7.53 but is possible now. TYPES:   BEGIN OF incl1,     num TYPE i,     c2  TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF incl1. DATA:   BEGIN OF struc1,     c1 TYPE c LENGTH 2.     INCLUDE TYPE incl1. DATA:     c3 TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF struc1. DATA:   BEGIN OF struc2,     c1  TYPE c LENGTH 2,     num TYPE i,     c2  TYPE c LENGTH 2,     c3  TYPE c LENGTH 2,   END OF struc2. struc1 = struc2. In the included substructure incl1, the character component has the same alignment as the integer component and there is no alignment gap. But as long as non-Unicode Systems were supported, an alignment gap had to be assumed behind the included structure in order to make the program executable in Unicode systems as well as in non-Unicode Systems. Hint When downporting programs from higher to lower releases, syntax errors might occur in the lower releases because of the stricter rules there. </td>

Here, the type SSTRING behaves like the data type CHAR. In a CAST expression, operands of the types CLNT, LANG, TIMS, and UNIT can now be cast to the types CHAR and SSTRING. Here, the target type must be specified as a data element. In a CAST expression, the data types CHAR, SSTR, and NUMC can now be cast to ACCP, and the other way round. Aggregate expressions can now be used as operands in a CAST expression. New Functions The following additional string functions are now supported: UPPER and LOWER The following additional date/time functions are now supported: ABAP_SYSTEM_TIMEZONE, ABAP_USER_TIMEZONE, TSTMP_TO_DATS, TSTMP_TO_TIMS, TSTMP_TO_DST, and DATS_TIMS_TO_TSTMP A new built-in conversion function FLTP_TO_DEC can be used to convert arguments of type FLTP to packed numbers. An addition AS dtype can now be specified for the aggregate expression AVG to determine the data type of the return value. Conditions Built-in functions can now be specified on the right side of a cond_expr condition of a WHERE condition, an ON condition, a filter condition, or a complex case distinction. In cond_expr conditions, fields of data sources of the type ACCP can now be compared with fields of the same type, and with literals of the type NUMC. The following changes have been made: In CAST expressions to data elements, the restriction no longer applies that the data type, the length, and the number of decimal places of operand and target data type must match precisely. This restriction can now be applied as an optional restriction using the new addition PRESERVING TYPE. This addition specifies explicitly that casts are to be applied to the semantic properties of a data element. PRESERVING TYPE suppresses the syntax warning that handles casts of identical technical types. </td>

Data elements can now be specified as the target type in CAST expressions. This passes its semantic properties to the result. This also makes it possible to map more built-in types to itself than previously. In CAST expressions, the restriction no longer applies that casts of operands of the types DEC, CURR, and QUAN to the same types expect the target type to be long enough. In casts from NUMC to NUMC, however, the lengths must now match exactly. CAST expressions can now be used to cast operands of the types DATS and TIMS to CHAR (if the length of the target type is sufficient). A one character literal with the type NUMC can now be compared with a data source of the type LANG. New SQL functions for CDS views: String functions: CONCAT_WITH_SPACE, INSTR, LEFT, LENGTH, LTRIM, RIGHT, RPAD,RTRIM Byte chain functions: BINTOHEX, HEXTOBIN Date functions and time functions for CDS views: The special date functions DATS_DAYS_BETWEEN, DATS_ADD_DAYS, and DATS_ADD_MONTHS make it possible to calculate with values of the built-in dictionary type DATS in CDS views. The new date function DATS_IS_VALID checks the validity of dates. The new time function TIMS_IS_VALID checks the validity of times. The new time stamp functions TSTMP_IS_VALID, TSTMP_CURRENT_UTCTIMESTAMP, TSTMP_SECONDS_BETWEEN and TSTMP_ADD_SECONDS perform operations with UTC time stamps in packed numbers. Input parameters from the parameter list parameter_list of a CDS view can be passed to many parameters of built-in functions.

Furthermore, accessing a view with parameters triggers a warning from the syntax check; this warning can be hidden by a pragma. </td>

In ABAP release 7.40, SP02, this parser will initially only be used for the statement SELECT. From ABAP release 7.40, SP05, the new parser will be used for all ABAP SQL statements. One consequence of this is that any following syntax constructs that have always contained errors now produce syntax errors or runtime errors. Corrections for the WHERE Condition All corrections in ABAP release 7.40, SP02 that apply to the WHERE condition now also apply to the statements DELETE, OPEN CURSOR, and UPDATE from ABAP release 7.40, SP05.

If SELECT is used with FOR ALL ENTRIES, table buffering is now also used when accessing tables with single record buffering and is no longer bypassed. SAP-internal hint Internally, a new buffer management was implemented that replaces the former buffer management. The new buffer management is based on the kernel-internal handling of internal tables and can make use of their secondary keys. In the new buffer management, the buffer is not bypassed any more when isolation level committed read is set. Before, the buffer had to be bypassed during committed read in order to prevent the selection of phantom data. This bypassing during committed read was not documented. </td>

This data object is used as a target area in each loop pass. Any modifications to the assignment of a field symbol or reference variable within the loop are ignored. From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, the assignment of a field symbol or reference variable is determined again for each loop pass and the current data object is used as the target area. </td>

<tr>
            <td>Stricter Checks on Syntax Rules</td>
            <td>In ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a new SQL parser was introduced for ABAP SQL. These parser performs stricter checks on some rules than the old parser. More specifically, the same parser is now used for statically specified ABAP SQL and for the content of dynamic tokens. In ABAP release 7.40, SP02, this parser will initially only be used for the statement SELECT. One consequence of this is that any following syntax constructs that have always contained errors now produce syntax errors or runtime errors. General corrections From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, the content of the operand n of the additions UP TO n ROWS and PACKAGE SIZE of the statement SELECT meet the rules of a lossless assignment for the data type i. Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02, the operator IN range_tab of a WHERE condition was not always checked statically to see whether the columns LOW and HIGH of the ranges table range_tab could be converted to the data type of the database and non-convertible columns did not produce a runtime error in cases where the ranges table was empty. Now, a static check is always made a non-convertible columns always raise an exception. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: DATA: range_tab TYPE RANGE OF t,       itab TYPE TABLE OF sflight. SELECT *        FROM sflight        INTO TABLE itab        WHERE fldate IN range_tab. Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02, multiple NOT operators could be placed consecutively in a WHERE condition. An even or odd number of consecutive NOT operators is the same as no NOT or a single NOT, which means that surplus NOT operators can now no longer be specified. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT SINGLE *        FROM spfli        INTO wa WHERE        NOT NOT carrid = 'LH'. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it was possible to read the client column when using alias names defined with AS or joins in ON and WHERE conditions, without disabling implicit client handling using CLIENT SPECIFIED. In this case, the result set is empty whenever the explicitly specified client is not the current client. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this situation produces a syntax check warning. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax warnings for: SELECT *        FROM scarr AS carriers        INTO TABLE itab        WHERE carriers~mandt = '...'. and SELECT *        FROM scarr        INNER JOIN spfli        on scarr~mandt = spfli~mandt        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE itab        WHERE scarr~mandt = '...'. The addition GROUP BY cannot be specified for pooled tables and cluster tables. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it was possible to specify a column dynamically after GROUP BY; however this always raised an exception. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a dynamically specified GROUP BY clause in pooled tables and cluster tables produces a syntax warning; this warning will become a syntax error in a future SP. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning or error for: SELECT id object langu typ        FROM doktl        INTO TABLE itab        GROUP BY (`ID OBJECT LANGU TYP`). Corrections for Dynamic Tokens Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a single period (.) could be specified in the dynamic tokens of any ABAP SQL statements. This period was ignored when the token was evaluated at runtime. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a period like this raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT *        FROM (`SPFLI .`)        INTO TABLE itab        WHERE (`. CARRID = 'LH'`). Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02, an alias name could be given more than once in cases where columns were specified dynamically in the SELECT list of the columns after SELECT using column_syntax, even though this is not allowed statically. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SEMANTICS. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT SINGLE ('carrid AS col carrname AS col')        FROM scarr        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF wa        WHERE carrid = 'LH'. Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02 the statically compulsory addition DISTINCT could be omitted when the aggregate function COUNT( DISTINCT col ) was specified dynamically and all rows of the result set were counted. From ABAP release7.40 SP02, the omission of DISTINCT raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT ('COUNT( carrid )')        FROM spfli        INTO count. ENDSELECT. In previous releases (before 7.40 SP02), a NOT could be mistakenly written directly in front of a comparison operator in a dynamic WHERE condition (which is not possible in the static case). With ABAP release 7.40 SP02 and higher, this raises an exception of class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, exception for: SELECT SINGLE *        FROM spfli        INTO wa        WHERE (`carrid NOT = 'LH'`). Before ABAP release 7.40, SP02 it was possible to use (incorrectly) a dynamic FROM clause combined with the addition ORDER BY PRIMARY KEY to access DDIC projection views containing the same number of key fields and view fields, which is not possible in static cases. From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, this raises the exception CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SYNTAX. Example From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, an exception is raised when projection_view has the same number of key fields and view fields. DATA itab TYPE TABLE OF projection_view. SELECT *        FROM ('KELLERH_VIEW')        INTO TABLE itab        ORDER BY PRIMARY KEY. SAP-internal hint For DDIC database views the exception is raised only in the strict modes from 7.40, SP05 on. Corrections for the aggregate function count( * ) As in all aggregate functions, the target field must be chosen appropriately in the case of count( * ) or count(*) and no values must be lost when the result is assigned. This was not checked before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, and assignments were made in accordance with the conversions rules. This did not always raise an exception when values were lost. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the target field must be numeric and a loss of values always produces an exception. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning and exception (if the value does not fit in the target field) for: DATA cnt TYPE c LENGTH 1. SELECT COUNT(*)        FROM scarr        INTO cnt. When individual columns or aggregate expressions are specified in the SELECT list, an explicit work area must usually be specified and the obsolete short form is not possible. The only exception here is when count( * ) is used to specify nothing, if no alias name and no GROUP BY clause was specified. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the short form using count( * ), specified together with an alias name or a GROUP BY clause, produced a runtime error. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: TABLES scarr. SELECT COUNT( * ) AS cnt        FROM scarr. SELECT count( * )        FROM scarr        GROUP BY carrid.    ... ENDSELECT. Corrections when using the built-in types LCHR and LRAW from ABAP Dictionary. Columns of the types LCHR and LRAW cannot be used in relational expressions of the SQL conditions. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this produced a runtime error. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT SINGLE *        FROM  indx        INTO wa        WHERE clustd = '...'. Columns of the types LCHR and LRAW cannot be read using SELECT if the addition DISTINCT is specified. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this produced a runtime error. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT DISTINCT *        FROM  indx        INTO TABLE itab. Columns of the types LCHR and LRAW can be read using SELECT only if they are read together with the associated length fields. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, columns of this type read without length fields produced a syntax warning. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this situation always produces a runtime error. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, runtime errors for: SELECT clustd        FROM  indx        INTO TABLE itab. Corrections for FOR ALL ENTRIES If FOR ALL ENTRIES is used in front of a WHERE condition of a SELECT statement, a column of the internal table must be specified in at least one comparison (the comparison can also be specified in a subquery). Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the subquery was not checked. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the comparison must be specified (statically or dynamically) even if a subquery is specified. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT carrid connid fldate        FROM sflight        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE rtab        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN itab        WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM sflight ). When FOR ALL ENTRIES is used in front of a WHERE condition of a SELECT statement, no database fields of the built-in types STRING and RAWSTRING plus LCHR and LRAW can occur in the SELECT list, since the implicit addition DISTINCT cannot be passed to the database system in this case. From ABAP release 7.40, SP02, a syntax warning occurs in the extended program check. This warning can be hidden by a pragma. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, pragma required for: SELECT *       FROM snwd_bpa       INTO TABLE bupas       FOR ALL ENTRIES IN orders       WHERE node_key = orders-buyer_guid       ##select_fae_with_lob[web_address]. If FOR ALL ENTRIES is used in front of a WHERE condition of a SELECT statement, no LOB handles can be created in the target area, since this produces an undefined result. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this was not identified correctly for locators, either statically or at runtime. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this produces a syntax error or raises an exception. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT picture        FROM demo_blob_table        INTO wa-picture        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN name_tab        WHERE name = name_tab-table_line. ENDSELECT. The addition FOR ALL ENTRIES should not be used with the addition GROUP BY. The addition GROUP BY is ignored if used together with FOR ALL ENTRIES. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this situation produces a syntax check warning. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax warning for: SELECT COUNT( * )        FROM spfli        INTO cnt        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN carriers        WHERE carrid = carriers-table_line        GROUP BY carrid. Corrections for ORDER BY Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it was possible to specify any text between a dynamically specified column after ORDER BY and the closing period of a SELECT statement and this text was ignored when the statement was executed. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this text produced a syntax warning; from ABAP release 7.40 SP02, it produces a syntax error. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax warning for: SELECT *        FROM scarr        INTO TABLE itab        ORDER BY (`CARRID`) carrname and so on. If the addition ORDER BY is specified together with FOR ALL ENTRIES, all columns of the primary key must be read; if not, the result is undefined. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning is produced in this case if known statically; at runtime, an exception is always raised. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a syntax warning or exception for: SELECT carrid connid        FROM sflight        INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE rtab        FOR ALL ENTRIES IN itab        WHERE carrid = itab-carrid AND              connid = itab-connid        ORDER BY PRIMARY KEY. If aggregate functions are specified after SELECT, all columns that are specified after ORDER BY and that do not have an alias name for an aggregation function must also be specified after SELECT and after GROUP BY. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the checks on this situation at runtime were not strict enough and the behavior was platform-dependent. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, a violation of this rule always raises an exception of the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SEMANTICS. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, an exception from the class CX_SY_DYNAMIC_OSQL_SEMANTICS for: SELECT COUNT( * )        FROM spfli        INTO (cnt)        GROUP BY ('CARRID')        ORDER BY ('CARRID').   ... ENDSELECT. An alias name in the SELECT list cannot be the name of a column to which no alias name is assigned. Before ABAP release 7.40 SP02, the use of a name of this type after ORDER BY raised an exception. From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, this also produces a syntax error if known statically. Example From ABAP release 7.40 SP02, syntax errors for: SELECT carrid connid AS carrid        FROM spfli        INTO TABLE itab        ORDER BY carrid. </td>

            <td>The rules described under Optimization of the WHERE Condition have been modified as follows: Except in comparisons for equality, optimizations are now also performed for the predicate expression IS INITIAL. This enables a simple check to be made on the initial value, in particular for columns typed as reference variables. A static WHERE condition cannot contain any duplicate or overlapping specified keys, if the prerequisites for optimizations are met. This means that this change is occasionally incompatible: Syntax errors are now produced in those WHERE conditions in which a key column is checked using both a comparison for equality with one value and using IS INITIAL. Syntax warnings are no longer produced by mistake for non-optimizable type combinations in comparisons, even if the comparison does not contain any key columns. Non-optimizable type combinations now produce syntax warnings only if they actually modify key fields of a hash key or of the initial part of a sorted key. The syntax warnings have been improved so that the non-optimizable combination is mentioned in the text. The following type combinations were not previously detected as non-optimizable when secondary keys were used in comparisons: string with n, i (b, s), f, decfloat16, and decfloat34 xstring with c and string There was no syntax error or exception in these cases. Instead, all lines of the internal table were checked linearly when the statement was executed or reads performed using the primary key. Optimized reads are guaranteed when using secondary keys, which is why the combinations above now produce syntax errors or raise exceptions. This represents an incompatible change. </td>

Also, standard tables were always searched linearly during key access. To be able to efficiently access an internal table with different keys, and to also allow efficient key access to standard tables, secondary table keys were introduced. From ABAP release 7.0, EhP2, secondary table keys can be defined for internal tables with TYPES and DATA as well as in ABAP Dictionary. An internal table can have up to 15 secondary table keys with different names. At the same time, what was previously the table key became the primary table key, and a predefined name for it, primary_key, was introduced. This can be replaced with an alias name in the enhanced definition of the primary table key in ABAP release 7.0, EhP2. Secondary table keys can be hash keys or sorted keys. A secondary table index is created for each sorted secondary key of an internal table. The previous table index, which exists only for index tables, becomes the primary table index.

If an update infringes the uniqueness of a secondary key, an exception is raised immediately. For block operations, such as statements between internal tables, or when internal tables are filled using SELECT, the behavior is the same as with inserting operations. When individual lines are modified using field symbols or data references that point to table lines, the secondary key administration of unique keys is updated upon the next access to the internal table (delayed update), and the secondary key administration of non-unique keys is updated upon the next explicit use of the secondary table key (lazy update). A uniqueness check is also run when the update is made. An internal table might therefore be in an inconsistent state with respect to the secondary key after individual lines are modified. An exception is not raised until the table is next used.

DF16_SCL and DF34_SCL are used by database fields in which decimal floating point numbers are stored with their scaling. In this kind of field, the decimal floating point numbers are stored as in DF16_RAW or DF34_RAW. The scaling must be specified in a direct successor database field with type INT2. When a decimal floating point number is written, this field is filled automatically with the scaling and the scaling is taken from it in reads. These data types are now obsolete and their use is strongly discouraged. Data elements with these types can be used to declare fields in database tables and in dynpros.

However, since the list only contains the same number of columns as there are positions in the list buffer, this means the list can only display fewer characters than are stored in the list buffer. The list output is therefore shortened accordingly and the page conforms to the alignment. The horizontal position of the list cursor is only the same in the non-Unicode systems as the output column of displayed or spooled lists. In Unicode systems, this is only guaranteed for the top and bottom output limits. The following changes were made in ABAP to comply with the behavior of lists in Unicode systems: If list output in a Unicode system is reduced, this is indicated by an indicator &gt; or &lt;. The complete content can then be displayed by choosing System ‚Üí List ‚Üí Unicode Display. So that unnecessary reductions are not made in the Unicode systems, the new specifications * and ** were introduced for the output length in the WRITE statement.

Actual parameters of type csequence and numeric are now accepted. A text-like parameter is interpreted as a component name, a numeric parameter as the position of the component in the structure.

If more than one repository object needs to be checked, for example all development objects in a package, these can be grouped together in an object set. It is also possible to define check variants with individual checks. A check of all objects in an object set using a specified check variant is called an inspection.

The ranking lists can be compiled according to specific criteria by choosing the function Change Settings. Memory consumption can now be displayed by choosing Goto ‚Üí Status Display ‚Üí Memory Usage. Breakpoints are defined according to whether they take effect in a HTTP session or in a standard session. HTTP debugging is activated in the editor by choosing Utilities ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí HTTP Debugging. Depending on the setting, the system then displays either the HTTP or standard breakpoints in the Editor. If, under Settings, the function Check Sorting Before READ BINARY SEARCH is selected, the system checks, before every execution of this statement, whether the internal table is sorted. If the table is not sorted, a runtime error occurs. This setting should only be activated shortly before reaching a relevant point in the source code, because there can be a significant loss in performance, depending on the table size. If the Check Sorting Before PROVIDE function was selected under settings, the system checks all of the relevant tables - and not just the area specified with extlim1 and extlim2 - for sorting and overlapping intervals when the long form of the PROVIDE statement is executed. When displaying exception objects, the system only displayed the key itself in the field display for the TEXTID attribute that contains the OTR key of the text description assigned to the exception. Because this key is generated automatically and is nothing more than a sequence of numbers, assigning the corresponding text to the exception was difficult. The reason for this is that the displayed value had to be compared with the values of all constants generated for the exception. To simplify the assignment, the name of the constant generated for the key is now displayed as a tooltip. For example, in the case of an exception of the type CX_SY_FILE_IO for the TEXTID attribute, the system displays READ_ERROR or WRITE_ERROR as a tooltip, depending on whether the exception was raised while reading or writing. The actual value of the attribute is the OTR key of the corresponding text description. By choosing Debugging ‚Üí Session, breakpoints and the settings System Debugging and Always Create Exception Object can now be saved persistently and reloaded later. The session can be saved by entering a name and expiration date for it. It is then available to other users and sessions, with the selected settings. </td>

If runtime analysis is called again, the system always displays the last used variant. Additionally, the create, delete, and copy functions are again included in the measurement restrictions block on the initial screen.

This is useful in cases where the whole list line (and not the field within the line) is relevant. Previously, the syntax rules required the addition FIELD to be used. Hint In general, the function GET CURSOR LINE l OFFSET o should be used when the absolute cursor position (column) within a list line is evaluated during an interactive list event. The system field SY-CUCOL does not refer to the list line, but to the displayed list section. After horizontal scrolling, the relative cursor position (SY-CUCOL) and the absolute cursor position are different. Furthermore, the system field SY-CUCOL contains the value 2 if (for reasons of compatibility) the cursor is on the first visible list column, which makes the calculation of the absolute position difficult. Example The following example shows how the previous usage of SY-CUCOL can be replaced by the function GET CURSOR: DATA: CURSORPOSITION TYPE I,       CURSOROFFSET   TYPE I,       CURSORLINE     TYPE I.

Previously, the list was displayed here in both cases (the triggering WRITE was ignored) and, if there was also indented list processing (LEAVE TO LIST-PROCESSING from CALL SCREEN), the entire list processing was terminated. Hint This change has the following consequence: In report processing (with a logical database), EXIT from TOP-OF-PAGE and END-OF-PAGE previously terminated processing of the logical database and branched directly to the list display. Now, only the event TOP-OF-PAGE or END-OF-PAGE is terminated. Any remaining logical database events (START-OF-SELECTION, GET, and so on) are not affected by this change. </td>

Here, the same process was chosen as already used for Screen Painter transactions. The underscore (_) allows you to vary the length for each entry. The underscore itself, however, is replaced by a blank before saving. As a result, underscores cannot be used in text symbols. In change mode, underscores (and therefore the internal length) are visible. In display mode, the text symbols are displayed as saved (without underscores). The Text Comparison function displays the text symbols in their defined lengths. Trailing blanks are shown as underscores. For all screens, the function Print has been added to the Text Elements menu. This function can be used to print a list of the required text elements, dependent on context. </td>
